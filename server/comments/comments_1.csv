comments  0$Très Bien dans l ensemble juste petit dej en chambre froid.... dommage. Top hôtel.
comments  1$Établissement très confortable et personnel accueillant.
comments  2$Déçu, réservation pour 1 nuit. Pas de sèche cheveux, une lampe au plafond qui pandouille, chambre exposée rue donc bruyante. Petit déjeuner un peu cher.
comments  3$Trés belle surprise ! Les chambres sont superbes et l l'agencement tres bien fait.
comments  4$Prestation qui n’est pas à la hauteur du prix de l’hôtel. Très déçu. L’hôtel demande une caution à l’arrivé.. Pourtant les chambres sont loin d’être chargées niveau équipement.. La fenêtre ne fermait pas bien, forcément pas d’isolation sonore. La chauffe serviette ne fonctionne pas. Nous avons organiser un dîner d’anniversaire qui s’est très mal passé niveau service. Rien a dire niveau cuisine c’était excellent. Le serveur nous préviens que les cuisines ferment à 22h00 et accepte une réservation de 15 personnes à 21h30 ... Aucun professionnalisme, le serveur nous reprochait qu’il nous attendait tout le temps. J’ai dû commander mon dessert à la moitié de mon plat.. Très très déçu .. c’est dommage. Même avec réduction je n’y mettrai plus les pieds.
comments  5$Parfait
comments  6$Très bon hôtel. Petit déjeuné et chambre d’un très bon standing.
comments  7$Très bel endroit, soigné, belle déco, staff professionnel, souriant, poli... 5 nuits au calme et reposant
comments  8$Très très beau lieu avec des personnes très sympas.
comments  9$Hôtel sympa, mais qui affiche quand même quelques traces d'usures dans le hall/ascenseurs. Les chambres sont quand à elles, très bien, spacieuses, literie excellente. Le bonus de la salle de fitness est bien quand le mauvais temps s'empare de Paris
comments  10$L’emplacement pas trop loin des transports. La chambre sympa mais la vue cour sur poubelle.
comments  11$Bon emplacement, bon petit dejeuner, design original
comments  12$Un superbe hotel avec une équipe au petits soins
comments  13$Bon choix d'hôtel situé à distance idéale de la Place de la République et des rues du Marais. L'accueil est sympathique et efficace. La chambre est correctement équipée, très propre et fonctionnelle. Il est peut-être un peu dommage qu'elle ne fasse pas écho à la déco des parties communes et des salles de restauration, vivante et agréable. Par contre, l'isolation de la fenêtre sur la rue est à revoir car le boulevard est assez bruyant. Le petit déjeuner manque peut-être un peu d'originalité mais les produits étaient de qualité.
comments  14$Hôtel accueillant différent confortable. Bar et coktails géniaux. Seul bémol : toilettes et salle de bain non séparés, dans la chambre directement ! Bien visible du lit. Intimité absolument pas préservée ! Un rideau ou porte battante serait extrêmement bienvenue.
comments  15$Hôtel agréable et bien placé pour notre séjour touristique
comments  16$Bel hôtel dans quartier vivant. Personnel très accueillant et chaleureux. Très bons petits-déjeuners. Manque juste un plateau de courtoisie en chambre avec bouilloire et cafetière comme dans l’ensemble des établissements 4 étoiles. Nous reviendrons.
comments  17$Tout s'est bien passé, accueil super - néanmoins j'avais sollicité à notre arrivée 2 coupes de champagne..... rien
comments  18$Hôtel très sympa, excellente qualité
comments  19$Great hotel, recommended!
comments  20$Very nice hotel, rooms are big and staff is wonderful
comments  21$Friendly staff, comfortable and clean room
comments  22$Great staff although could explain facilities better when checking in, hotel had a bar that we didn’t find out about until the day we left. Rooms are massive for a European city hotel. The room we stayed in could have done with a little TLC, room was generally clean and tidy but was in need of a lick of paint and touch up. Only issue we had was on the first day the maid wanted to clean our room at 5pm. all in all a good hotel.
comments  23$Absolutely fabulous hotel, from the rooms to the restaurant to the wonderful staff & even to the cool ‘speakeasy’ hidden out the back. We will return as it was an amazing trip! Many thanks.
comments  24$Cool boutique hotel in a very central area of Marais. The staff was very nice and overall loved the design, features, and comfort of the hotel. Everything was great from sleep to amenities.
comments  25$A wonderful somewhat funky boutique property with nice rooms. The only issue we had was that the bathroom was very cold.
comments  26$Shower did not drain. Asked staff to address it, nothing was done. Dirty glasses were left after housekeeping came.
comments  27$Starting from the front desk , they made my first trip to Paris aa enjoyable one. Room with the King bed was awesome and so was breakfadt, staff helpful. Hotel perfectly located in Paris., will stay again.
comments  28$Unique boutique style hotel in a buzzy area, comfortable bed, nice decor and friendly helpful staff(especially Nieves!) would stay again
comments  29$Great location to stay in Paris and lovely hotel. Junior sweet was very spacious. Gym was great and had everything for a good workout. Staff were very lovely and happy to help with any requests.
comments  30$I selected this hotel because it was a VIP property but I did not get any VIP amenities
comments  31$Great staff and wonderful breakfast. We asked to switch rooms because of the noise and they accommodated us right away. Very stylish hotel. Would stay there again.
comments  32$The toilet was in a seperate room from the shower which was strange. The room with the toilet also did not have a sink in it and it was on the opposite site of the shower room than the sink which resulted in a poor layout. The room was very loud. You could hear anyone in the halls and also there was constantly loud music coming from outside at night which made sleeping difficult.
comments  33$Wonderful! Beautiful property, great location, great breakfast.
comments  34$Great location. Friendly staff. The rooms were clean and there was a coffee machine in our family room which was s great bonus after coming in from a long day out.
comments  35$The XL Junior Suite was spacious and clean. My friend and I enjoyed all the space. The bathroom was large and luxurious. Beware it is an open concept bathroom, so you will not have any privacy while showering or bathing. The only door is for the small room with the toilet. This can be tricky when you are staying with someone. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The hotel is in the Marais neighborhood, so you will have access to a plethora of restaurants, cafes, bars, and stores. There is a metro station at the corner, which we used. We also took a lot of Uber rides, and drivers had no issue finding us. If I return to Paris, I would definitely stay there and in request that room!
comments  36$Good location, nice big and clean room, helpful staff.
comments  37$This is a wonderful hotel in a great area. The metro stop is right outside and convenient to get anywhere in Paris. We had to move out of a bad airbnb experience. We moved to this hotel and realized we should have been there the whole time. Staff was wonderful and helpful. Great blow dryers in the room, air conditioning was great. Very Clean! Beds were so comfortable! TV with lots of free movies, big closets. Everything we needed and more! Great price too!
comments  38$XL duplex room was perfect for a family, split level room meant everyone had space but always knew the kids were safe. Housekeeping came every day which meant lovely clean bedding and towels always. The beds were super comfy. Two bathrooms were a much enjoyed luxury. Sadly overcharged on city tax when I left, was charged for my children even though listing says under 18’s were free. Also on our first night had terrible service (given half drinks as tap was broken and still charged full price) in the bar, meant we didn’t go back. Would stay in the hotel again though.
comments  39$Amazing location. Breakfast was awesome. Rooms are big and cozy. Loved this hotel :)
comments  40$Great location, nice hotel.
comments  41$Fantastic... we'll be back
comments  42$Close to a metro stop. Close to the best patisserie in all of Paris (Aux Peches Normands) and the room is huge for Parisian hotels. I did have the deluxe room which is worth paying a little extra for. Staff is very friendly.
comments  43$I had requested a room with two beds in a quiet location. The room was as requested, spacious, with adequate closet space for two females. The beds were fine, though sheets could be softer. Glad we brought our own pillowcases. The a/c was excellent. The bathroom was fine, appreciated the make up mirror and found the shower excellent. The google phone didn’t work well and they forgot to clean my room one day. The hotel is in a great location, neighborhood, close to metro. The lobby bathrooms could use more lighting, maintenance, and upgrading. The staff were always helpful. I absolutely recommend.
comments  44$Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Room was spacious, modern and immaculate. The bed was extremely comfortable. The restaurant and bar were very good. All of the staff were super friendly and very helpful. The location is excellent, very close to two metro stations and lots of cafes.The only negatives for me were that my room was above the bar and the music was a little loud for a few hours in the evening; and the shower had the typical european half wall....water Everywhere!!!
comments  45$The location is great, our room was spacious, and breakfast was wonderful.
comments  46$Loved the location and the people were very nice. The bar was good. The bathroom was poor in terms of a very badly designed shower over the bath which was also not very powerful, glass screen hanging off, tap coming off, grouting coming out, poor lighting etc
comments  47$Great location. Good sized room. Very comfortable. Staff very helpful.
comments  48$Ce n'est pas un 4 etoiles.
comments  49$Hôtel sympa, personnel très sympathique, hôtel bruyant côté rue. J’ai demander un surclassement à ma charge et dans la mesure du possible j’ai pu avoir une chambre plus spacieuse et calme. Petit dej particulier en chambre mais quand même bon.
comments  50$Un accueil très chaleureux un service irréprochable salle de bains simple et fonctionnelle La décoration de la chambre en référence à Kipling et aux voyages est de très bon goût.
comments  51$Bon hôtel Service top
comments  52$Boutique hôtel à rénover sérieusement.non conforme aux indications du site de réservation. Site pas à jour rapport à Covid 19. Très décevant. Bruyant. Pas de rideaux aux fenêtres. rideaux de nuit fermés tout le temps car les vis à vis voient dans la chambre. Chambre minuscule. Pas téléphone pas de réfrigérateur. Je ne recommande absolument pas. Dommage
comments  53$Nous avions demandé deux lits dans une chambre supérieure et nous n'avons eu qu'un seul lit. Impossibilité de changer après que l'accueil ai dit que sans doute cela était dû à une erreur ce qui semblait évident. Par ailleurs, lors d'une alarme incendie intempestive le 11 juillet à 0h45 nous sommes sortis par l'escalier de secours. A ce moment là la poignée de la porte de l'escalier de secours du 1er étage s'est désolidarisée car non fixée ce qui représente un danger évident. Le petit déjeuner et les services en général étaient indignes d'un 4 étoiles. Dans la salle de bain le lavabo et le sèche serviette avaient été réparés à la va vite et fixés de travers. etc. etc.
comments  54$Hôtel tres bien situé. Chambre un peu petite. Manque d'emplacements pour mettre la valise et affaires de toilettes dans la salle de bains. Mais sinon très bel hôtel.
comments  55$Mauvaise odeur dans la salle de bain Tout s'est bien passé
comments  56$Joli petit hôtel juste à côté du moulin rouge, mais gros cafouillage le dernier jour...avec des touristes polonais qui ont été refoulé au pti dej, moi non, et du coup c'était très gênant...Je me suis absenté 5min pour passer un coup de tel et à mon retour la table était débarrassé!du coup j'ai pas fini...jai pas fait dhistoire mais ça laisse à désirer surtout quand la gérante vous dit de venir avec votre cafe à la réception...
comments  57$telecommande HS donc TV monochaine allemande ! deux serviettes dans la salle d' attente dont une pour nain ras par ailleurs douche très parisienne !, personnel très serviable et discret
comments  58$Tromperie, cet hotel est loin de correspondre à un 4 étoiles tout au plus 3 étoiles. chambres petites salle de bain petite lavabo minuscule, escalier descendant à la salle des DJ mal entretenus !!! entre autre. les photos sont trompeuses car elles donnent un apercu très avantageux de l'hotel très décu car on s'attend à un autre niveau de prestation pour un 4 étoiles, niveau que nous fréquentons régulièrement
comments  59$État de propreté qui laisse à désirer, mauvaise odeur et pas d’eau chaude le matin !
comments  60$Bon séjour, très bon accueil, Ines est très sympathique et prévenante. Très bien situé, quartier dynamique. Seul bémol : le petit déjeuner était un peu décevant quant à la qualité des produits proposés.
comments  61$4 etoiles ? Bof
comments  62$Personnel acceuillant et a l'écoute. Chambre pas tres spacieuse mais bien agencée
comments  63$Parfait pour se balader à pied jusque Montmartre (20 minutes)
comments  64$
comments  65$Hotel acceuillant, personnel au top, à 200m du métro et taxis. Je recommande
comments  66$chambre très petite, sombre, manque de voilage aux fenêtres avec gros vis-à-vis,ampoule manquante non remplacée alors que demandé 2 fois, télé qui ne marchait pas (télécommande a été remplacée), oubli de remettre du gel douche lors du ménage, une blatte dans les toilettes...
comments  67$Hotel was older than expected. Staff where Nice but could help with re-freshing
comments  68$The advertising looked amazing but upon arrival it was not as expected. The room was crammed and the floor was dull and needs updating
comments  69$Room a little on the small side, over all it was alright staff friendly and helpful
comments  70$A quaint and quirky hotel with comfortable beds and a decent bathroom. However there was hardly any provision to hang clothes and the coffee maker had seen better days.
comments  71$The location was good, the room was nice and enough just to sleep in, with unique decor. The amenities could have been better, but the staff were very friendly.
comments  72$Central Location and nice décor in the hotel. staff were very friendly and helpful
comments  73$Great location and friendly staff clean would stay again
comments  74$I have stayed here maby times and appreciate the local neighborhood type flair. I do miss the nightly wine tasting, which they apparently no longer do even though it says they do in their website and in Cheaptickets write up.
comments  75$
comments  76$Room is small but everything is fine. Quiet and clean. The service is good too. Probably will visit again
comments  77$They combined two single beds to form a “queen” size bed. Apart from that, service staffs are quite polite
comments  78$Our room was tiny. Very difficult to do anything in other than sleep. Even moving around each other/the room was awkward. That said, the location is fine, the neighborhood seemed safe, within walking distance of several sites and close to the subway. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The wifi works very well.
comments  79$Great stay at the hotel. Clean rooms and very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to friends and family if they are visiting.
comments  80$The location was real convenient. A brief Metro ride (2) from Gard du Nord and just down the block from the Moulin Rouge. The breakfasts were quite good and plentiful. The staff was more than friendly and ever-willing to assist. Our room was quaint, but it was clean and fun to live in for 6 nights.
comments  81$Service good, staff friendly and helpful.
comments  82$Nice quirky hotel with friendly desk staff. Room is very small but clean and modern bathroom. Excellent location close to the Moulin Rouge and Metro station.
comments  83$The first room we got was too small so we asked for another one. There was no floor space to walk on and it was a bit dusty, to be honest. The person who checked us in was very helpful, though, and tried to work out a solution for us. We were transferred to another room as soon as there was one available (the day after we checked in). The rest of the staff seemed nice as well so it wasn't too bad overall.
comments  84$We absolutely loved this hotel! A very pleasant experience overall! The staff was very pleasant and kind. They offered help without being asked. They would anticipate your needs and make appropriate offer to help which a hotel room experience should be!
comments  85$Reception staff were great, very friendly and welcoming
comments  86$The hotel is lovely however, our room was tiny, it was not a twin room as requested, and we only had 1 towel on the first night.
comments  87$I had the most wonderful experience. The front desk staff we delightful and very friendly. They really cared about my time spent in Paris and at the hotel. Great location. Overall just a lovely experience.
comments  88$Everyone who works at this charming boutique hotel is warm, help and goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. I highly recommend!
comments  89$Great location amazing staff unique and beautiful rooms. First incredible stay in Paris highly recommended.
comments  90$Great breakfast! Nice and clean room ! No parking
comments  91$I loved our room and the hotel was so charming. We paid extra for a larger room but it was still smaller than American hotels. The bathroom and balcony were amazing. Staff was amazing and helpful. We loved our stay
comments  92$Friendly staff and clean room. Near lots of restaurants and the Moulin Rouge.
comments  93$This quaint hotel is centrally located near many good eats and cute cafes. You can take a romantic stroll around the neighborhood and hike up to one of the popular churches. The staff, especially the front desk people, are extremely welcoming and helpful.
comments  94$The hotel wasn’t fancy but with the excellent service provided by the wonderful staff we felt like we were staying at a five star hotel. Etienne and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay in Paris was pleasant. Will definitely stay with them again!
comments  95$The rooms are too small, it’s hard to move around.
comments  96$This hotel is walking distance from Moulin Rouge.the stuff are very helpful. This is a very clean hotel and is very easy to locate. There is no parking on site but you can find on street parking.
comments  97$I like this hotel location, very convenient . Staff very nice , and helpful.
comments  98$Enfin un hôtel ou l'on se sent bien. Un accueil au top Des chambres super propres, bonne literie Et surtout un room service parfait, des plats de qualité et super bon. Je recommande pour le travail ou en famille.
comments  99$Très bon confort. Personnel sympathique Bon repas
comments  100$J'ai été très bien accueilli. La chambre et la salle de bains sont aménagées et décorées avec goût. La formule à 18 € avec entrée, plat et dessert est d'un très bon rapport qualité/prix. Le dîner fût juste délicieux de l'entrée (capanota), le cheeseburger cuit juste comme demandé et le baba au limoncello excellent également. Bref, j'y retournerai avec plaisir.
comments  101$Une équipe au top accueil chaleureux et vraiment hâte d'y retrourner pendant le travail je le recommande et en plus service restauration sur place et surtout au barbu qui es super cool
comments  102$Jolie reprise d’hôtel par des jeunes hyper motivés et adorables
comments  103$Accueil parfait et chambre nickel
comments  104$Un accueil ultra agréable ! Un personnel au petit soin, une déco super et un service irréprochable pendant cette crise sanitaire
comments  105$
comments  106$L'accueil a été très convenable et le confort excellent. Le petit déjeuner est servi très agréablement. Manque un peu de choix et j'aurais aimé avoir des oeufs, mais ce n'est pas dramatique. Le seul dommage est que ma chaise était un peu basse par rapport à la table, ce qui rendait la chose un peu moins confortable
comments  107$
comments  108$Chambre très agréable, personnel sympathique et confortable pour cette période de couvre-feu. Je n'ai pas toutefois pu utiliser le hammam (il faut réserver à l'avance malheureusement semble t'il) et la bière était un peu chère même si elle était très bienvenue Bref j'y retournerais avec joie
comments  109$RAS. Le top. Super accueil et particulièrement durant le petit déjeuner. Bravo !
comments  110$
comments  111$Propreté de la chambre service d’accueil au top Conseil : faites le hammam pour 30 min au minimum
comments  112$Très bon séjour, l’accueil était parfait
comments  113$Hotel de charme tres bien situé dans un quartier animé, mais dans une rue calme. Ma chambre tres agreable, d'une bonne surface, a la decoration soignée et originale, bien isolée, excellente literie. Sdd tres moderne, propreté inpeccable. Petit dej. continental dans un cadre lumineux et bien decoré. Accueil et service parfait. J'ai passé un moment tres agréable.
comments  114$Très bel hôtel et un accueil parfait
comments  115$Personnel aux petits soins et très agréable. Belle décoration, très joli concept. Chambe propre et confortable.
comments  116$La chambre calme avec une superbe décoration ! La localisation en plein coeur de Paris et à proximité de La Madeleine vous offre l'accès aux différents transports rapidement permettant un accès au différents endroits de Paris en quelques minutes.
comments  117$Hôtel atypique, musique à l'accueil très sympathique. Personnel avenant et chambre propre.
comments  118$Séjour du 10 au 11 mars, une semaine avant le confinement généralisé. Très peu de clients dans l'hotel. Personnel parfaitement aimable et serviable, je leur souhaite de parvenir à traverser la crise actuelle pour pouvoir repartir. Déco très originale.
comments  119$Hotel bien placé. Par contre chambre donnant sur une rue broyante, et le petit déjeuner décevant notamment en vue du prix. Meme plus de pain à 9h...
comments  120$Très bel hôtel, moderne, décalé et confortable avec un personnel charmant. L'emplacement est idéal, entre les Grands Magasins et l'Olympia, pour les afficionados du shopping et des concerts et théâtre, c'est le point de chute par excellence.
comments  121$personnel tres pro
comments  122$Bon séjour Seul problème très gênant est de pourvoir régler le stationnement
comments  123$Séjour d’une nuit pour un concert à l’Olympia. Idéalement placé, 2 mn à pieds. Accueil convivial et personnel très serviable. Chambre très propre et bien insonorisée. Deco dans le thème de la soirée. Un regret : pas avoir eu le temps de tester le spa.
comments  124$Très bien placé, décoration soignée. chambres très petites mais confortables Petit déjeuner hors de prix pour ce qui y est servi
comments  125$Belle deco, propre, pratique. Déjeuner très médiocre pour ce prix.
comments  126$Très bon rapport qualité prix dans un quartier vivant et proche de lieux stratégiques
comments  127$Nous avions choisi cet hôtel pour sa proximité avec l'Olympia et nous avons appréciés l'accueil très agréable, le décor original 🎼🎹🎸 ainsi que le calme et la propreté de la chambre. Bref une belle escale après notre soirée à l'Olympia 😀
comments  128$Accueil parfait. Chambres agréable
comments  129$Personnel très accueillant. Chambre propre et spacieuse.
comments  130$Proche de l'Olympia et du métro , hôtel que je recommande fortement , personnel très sympathique , chambre propre , jolie déco .
comments  131$On s'y sent comme chez soi Déco très agréable Chambres confortables Service impeccable Accueil charmant
comments  132$Très bon hôtel idéalement placé entre Madeleine et Opéra, confortable, chaleureux, sympathique, dans une rue calme.
comments  133$Hôtel bien situé, dans une rue plutôt calme. Literie confortable. Points à ameliorer: fournir des couvertures dans les chambres et le petit déjeuner est assez décevant (notamment la partie salé avec de la charcuterie pas appétissante)
comments  134$Accueil très bien, chambre agréable, propre et super déco, petit déjeuner un peu cher mais inclut dans le prix de la chambre, rien à redire !!
comments  135$Hotel tres bien placé et tres agreable
comments  136$Excellent, très bien placé, calme, rien à dire
comments  137$Hôtel au style atypique, confortable et plutôt bien situé (à 2 pas de la Madeleine et accès métro). Tarif plutôt élevé pour la prestation, chambre très simple.
comments  138$Bon hotel, trés bien situé. Chambre agréable, belle déco. Rue parfois un peu bruillante. Petit déjeuner un peu léger ...
comments  139$Très bien
comments  140$Deuxième séjour a cet hôtel . Les règles sanitaires étaient respectées par les membres du personnel. Hôtel très bien situé et très propre.
comments  141$
comments  142$Amazing location just 5-10min from Place Vendome and Louvree Museum. Rooms were nice with cute view. Stuff in the hotel is very helpful and amazing :)
comments  143$Hotel was great. Clean, modern and friendly staff. Also quick to check out
comments  144$Checks all the boxes for us, great location, close to Metro, AC blows cold, legitimately pet friendly, no on-site but paid parking very close, Expedia VIP perks, comfortable bed, decent sized rooms. We'll stay here again.
comments  145$Excellent value for money. Regarding cleanliness, they could improve the measures against covid-19: they do have hand sanitizer and a wide protection screen at reception but in the room they continue to use bed cushions and a decorative bedspread that are difficult to clean every time a guest checks out.
comments  146$This hotel was perfect for me and my wife. It is centrally located, tons of restaurants and shops in the immediate area and only a 4 min walk to the metro. You can ask for a better hotel for the price. All staff are friendly and extremely helpful. I can remember the gentleman’s name but are flight came in early and we arrived at 0800 in the morning. This is away before normal check in hours but he took us in with no problem and since I am a gold member with Expedia he gave us a room upgrade. Are room was on very nice and clean and mini bar came stock and come to find out are room had a balcony which gave us a beautiful view of the city and streets. I highly recommend this hotel and we can’t wait to go back next Time.
comments  147$Tiny room, but great location
comments  148$This is a cool, local boutique hotel. The whole place including room interiors is decorated to look like you’re on a rock n roll tour. It’s conveniently located to great restaurants and lots of shopping.
comments  149$Very good location,perfect services,very friendly staffs.
comments  150$Great hotel and location. A bar would be lovely and also no tea and coffee facilities in the room. Road works outside the building where a ramp was installed was noise in the night when cars drove over. Very friendly staff. Clean and large rooms.
comments  151$Fantastic find - excellent location, fun decor, spotless, front desk MORE than helpful, breakfast excellent, bed super comfortable and great bathtub for a soak!
comments  152$Horrible experience. Nobody here cares about you. This place is nice but the front desk staff is not. Still waiting to talk to the manager, never saw her in four days and still waiting on the call I was supposed to receive from her.
comments  153$The front desk staff was wonderful, the room was spacious, I was very comfortable and very happy with the location. The hotel is an exceptional value. The bed was a little bit hard but other than that everything was excellent.
comments  154$The bathroom door handle was broken. Staff are friendly and cheerfully The room is so modern and chill
comments  155$We really liked this property. The place was very clean and that’s our number one priority. The location was excellent as it was close to most places we needed to go. They have air conditioning and an elevator and everyone spoke English.

comments  25$Great location and friendly staff clean would stay again
comments  26$I have stayed here maby times and appreciate the local neighborhood type flair. I do miss the nightly wine tasting, which they apparently no longer do even though it says they do in their website and in Cheaptickets write up.
comments  27$
comments  28$Room is small but everything is fine. Quiet and clean. The service is good too. Probably will visit again
comments  29$They combined two single beds to form a “queen” size bed. Apart from that, service staffs are quite polite
comments  30$Our room was tiny. Very difficult to do anything in other than sleep. Even moving around each other/the room was awkward. That said, the location is fine, the neighborhood seemed safe, within walking distance of several sites and close to the subway. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The wifi works very well.
comments  31$Great stay at the hotel. Clean rooms and very friendly staff. Would definitely recommend to friends and family if they are visiting.
comments  32$The location was real convenient. A brief Metro ride (2) from Gard du Nord and just down the block from the Moulin Rouge. The breakfasts were quite good and plentiful. The staff was more than friendly and ever-willing to assist. Our room was quaint, but it was clean and fun to live in for 6 nights.
comments  33$Service good, staff friendly and helpful.
comments  34$Nice quirky hotel with friendly desk staff. Room is very small but clean and modern bathroom. Excellent location close to the Moulin Rouge and Metro station.
comments  35$The first room we got was too small so we asked for another one. There was no floor space to walk on and it was a bit dusty, to be honest. The person who checked us in was very helpful, though, and tried to work out a solution for us. We were transferred to another room as soon as there was one available (the day after we checked in). The rest of the staff seemed nice as well so it wasn't too bad overall.
comments  36$We absolutely loved this hotel! A very pleasant experience overall! The staff was very pleasant and kind. They offered help without being asked. They would anticipate your needs and make appropriate offer to help which a hotel room experience should be!
comments  37$Reception staff were great, very friendly and welcoming
comments  38$The hotel is lovely however, our room was tiny, it was not a twin room as requested, and we only had 1 towel on the first night.
comments  39$I had the most wonderful experience. The front desk staff we delightful and very friendly. They really cared about my time spent in Paris and at the hotel. Great location. Overall just a lovely experience.
comments  40$Everyone who works at this charming boutique hotel is warm, help and goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. I highly recommend!
comments  41$Great location amazing staff unique and beautiful rooms. First incredible stay in Paris highly recommended.
comments  42$Great breakfast! Nice and clean room ! No parking
comments  43$I loved our room and the hotel was so charming. We paid extra for a larger room but it was still smaller than American hotels. The bathroom and balcony were amazing. Staff was amazing and helpful. We loved our stay
comments  44$Friendly staff and clean room. Near lots of restaurants and the Moulin Rouge.
comments  45$This quaint hotel is centrally located near many good eats and cute cafes. You can take a romantic stroll around the neighborhood and hike up to one of the popular churches. The staff, especially the front desk people, are extremely welcoming and helpful.
comments  46$The hotel wasn’t fancy but with the excellent service provided by the wonderful staff we felt like we were staying at a five star hotel. Etienne and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay in Paris was pleasant. Will definitely stay with them again!
comments  47$The rooms are too small, it’s hard to move around.
comments  48$This hotel is walking distance from Moulin Rouge.the stuff are very helpful. This is a very clean hotel and is very easy to locate. There is no parking on site but you can find on street parking.
comments  49$I like this hotel location, very convenient . Staff very nice , and helpful.
comments  50$Enfin un hôtel ou l'on se sent bien. Un accueil au top Des chambres super propres, bonne literie Et surtout un room service parfait, des plats de qualité et super bon. Je recommande pour le travail ou en famille.
comments  51$Très bon confort. Personnel sympathique Bon repas
comments  52$J'ai été très bien accueilli. La chambre et la salle de bains sont aménagées et décorées avec goût. La formule à 18 € avec entrée, plat et dessert est d'un très bon rapport qualité/prix. Le dîner fût juste délicieux de l'entrée (capanota), le cheeseburger cuit juste comme demandé et le baba au limoncello excellent également. Bref, j'y retournerai avec plaisir.
comments  53$Une équipe au top accueil chaleureux et vraiment hâte d'y retrourner pendant le travail je le recommande et en plus service restauration sur place et surtout au barbu qui es super cool
comments  54$Jolie reprise d’hôtel par des jeunes hyper motivés et adorables
comments  55$Accueil parfait et chambre nickel
comments  56$Un accueil ultra agréable ! Un personnel au petit soin, une déco super et un service irréprochable pendant cette crise sanitaire
comments  57$
comments  58$Très agréable !! Je recommande
comments  59$Tres bien comme d’habitude avec des proprios tres sympa
comments  60$Mon séjour à l' hôtel fut très agréable. La décoration est très classe. Le petit déjeuner était parfait de plus accompagné de musique française intemporelle. Merci à l'équipe !
comments  61$J'ai séjourné dans une chambre spacieuse, la salle de bains l'était également, le quartier est très chouette, la literie st parfaite, le service adorable. Je n'ai pas pris de pdj.
comments  62$BEL ETABLISSEMENT DANS UN BEAU QUARTIER A QUELQUES PAS DE NOTRE DAME ET DU CELEBRE CABARETE LE PARADIS LATIN
comments  63$Rien à dire très bon hôtel. Bien isolé au niveau bruit sauf les clients qui font du bruit en rentrant le soir
comments  64$Bon pour un court séjour, avec une situation géographique intéressante
comments  65$Excellent rapport qualité / prix dans un quartier de Paris animé. Petit-déjeuner généreux et varié .
comments  66$It is a family and authentic atmosphere in a very touristic neighborhood.
comments  67$
comments  68$Rideau occultant, qui n'occulte pas assez et un réverbère énorme juste devant la fenêtre. Pas de mitigeur et lorsque quelqu'un d'autre prend une douche ou se lave les dents, l'eau devient brulante. Les oreillers sont trop volumineux. Cela peut plaire à certaines personnes et pas à d'autres. Il faudrait proposer 2 tailles d'oreillers. Pas de bouilloire dans la chambre, rien pour se faire un thé ou une tisane le soir.
comments  69$Très bon accueil de l'équipe
comments  70$Rue extrêmement bruyante jusque tard dans la nuit (groupes de personnes qui parlent fort, rient, écoutent de la musique), mauvaise isolation phonique, bouchons d'oreille indispensables pour dormir
comments  71$Hotel TB Expedia beaucoup moins (peut-être par manque d'attention mais j'en suis pas certain) sur le site les petits déjeuner étaient compris, à l'arrivée sur le mail NON Avec
comments  72$2 restaurants et bars à proximité Très bruyant jusque très tard ds la nuit Pas de double vitrage, climatisation en panne
comments  73$une nuit pour affaires Taille de la chambre raisonnable pour Paris
comments  74$Hotel et chambre agréable : Mobilier et aménagement de l'hôtel original. Lit trés confortable, salle de bains de bonne taille. Bon petit déjeuner complet il manque juste une machine expresso. Quelques prises supplémentaires seraient nécessaires proche du bureau dans la chambre et un réglage de la télévision pour avoir toutes les chaines disponibles.
comments  75$Isolations extérieur inssufisante. Quartiers tres bruyant.chambre sans charme.
comments  76$accueil sympathique, chambre assez grande, situation exceptionnelle. la salle de bains est grande et très propre, le petit déjeuner est copieux et varié.Bon rapport qualité/prix
comments  77$Reception par une personne ne parlant pas bien le français...avec légère prise de tête pour régler en CB; étant pressée le lendemain, je voulais payer en arrivant.Cela ne fonctionnait pas;annulation 3 fois de la CB; appel du gérant; attente; encore pbm et prise des arrhes au final...avec suspicion que je n'avais pas la somme !!!En arrivant dans la chambre, cela sentait légèrement la cigarette(mais peut être les personnes avant n'ont pas respecté le contrat...). Le lendemain, aucun pbm pour retirer de l'argent ailleurs..
comments  78$Excellent hôtel, éviter les chambres sur la rue assez bruyantes car bar restaurant en face
comments  79$L'accueil et le confort bien centré, mais lieu passablement bruyant dû à un trafic SUR UN CARREFOUR et des bars sur le trottoir.
comments  80$The staff are so friendly, especially the owner. Welcomed us as if we were family. Comfortable room with view over a street at the side. Nice linen. Up to date style. Nice breakfast
comments  81$Very good, elegant and very convenient
comments  82$Great hotel and very friendly staff. Located in the heart of the Quartier Latin with easy access to Metro stations and buses. Super breakfast. Clean and comfortable with good quality double glazing so when the windows were closed there was no traffic noise. Definitely recommend.
comments  83$Hotel suited our needs well. On a major road so bit noisy but staff were great and let us leave our bags after checkout Thank you
comments  84$The property was located in the 5th district and had the charms of an old hotel that fit right into the scene of the Latin Quarter
comments  85$The main person at the check in desk was amazing. Very helpful with suggestions for restaurants, bakeries, activities, and fun to talk to. And the room was very nice.
comments  86$
comments  87$breakfast should improve, baguette and pastries fresher ; vegetables were missed
comments  88$Location excellent. Bed comfortable. Would have been nice to have an armchair - desk chair base is wooden and hard. Black and red discolouration (mould?) in the bathroom. Towels clean but sad.
comments  89$This is a traditional Parisian building and gives a flavour of the city. That means that if you are looking for an up to the minute swish hotel, you’re in the wrong place but if you want a very well-located hotel with friendly staff, go for it. We stayed on the first floor and there were a few issues - sink tap leaked slightly, window could do with net curtains because it’s so low, and you can hear louder music on Saturday nights - but otherwise it’s fine. We only came in to sleep basically. The aircon works well, there was plenty of hot water day and night, the windows do soundproof barring the Saturday music. As I said, its location is the best asset, 10 mins to walk to the Seine and Notre Dame is pretty good. Also, check out the Pizza Bonvivant just over the road. Lovely pizzas (nothing else on the menu, they do one thing well) and super-friendly staff.
comments  90$Hotel on very busy and loud corner. I would do more research to find quieter, side street in the future.
comments  91$This is a charming, well maintained property, in a wonderful location, close to restaurants and cafes, as well as public transportation. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was was lovely and exceptionally clean, and the beds were comfortable. This is a fabulous hotel!
comments  92$Location is great ! The staff are all very nice and always smiling and helpful. Noise insulation wasn't good enough. Breakfast could be better.
comments  93$OK well located smallish hotel with jus a few problems. Our room was not far from reception on the ground for. Room 001. No noise insulation so we could hear all the comings and goings. Also being the ground floor w were right next door to a (I assume) staff scooter and moped park. The windows were clearly not double or triple glazed. Room wasn't serviced on day 1. We were out all day until 5pm and that's when the turned up just after we'd got back to the hotel. All day to do it, but only pass by at 5? We said no thanks. The staff were all OK, but I have to admit - knowing Paris really well - I wouldn't go back.
comments  94$Nice area to explore. Quiet, but interesting.
comments  95$Friendly staff but room was very small and a bit dated
comments  96$Really nice stay... our bathroom was huge and the room was a good size. I asked for twin beds in advance and got them. The local area is relatively quiet although the walls are thin and you’re more likely to hear what’s going on next door than outside. It didn’t bother us greatly though. Would definitely recommend.
comments  97$Bit pricey for overall value. It was very noisy across the street but that wasn’t hotel’s fault. Nevertheless it was hard to sleep.
comments  98$Great location, very helpful and friendly staff. Convenient neighborhood, walking distance to many sights.
comments  99$Great!!!
comments  100$Love the location. This was my second stay. First was with my daughter, Kara in August 2015. I also referred the Greene family who stayed with you August 2018 before I arrived this time. The only complaint I have is that you are no longer including the breakfast and to pay $14 euros is a bit much. Therefore, we didn't eat your breakfast but went to the diner down the street about a half block and it was super reasonable. We ate most breakfasts at the diner.
comments  101$Short 3 night stay.Only down was the noise from outside early morning with workmen digging the road,however this should end soon. Breakfast was very good and all the staff were very nice and helpful.Would certainly return to this hotel.
comments  102$Great location, excellent staff. Although in busy area it was quiet. AC worked great. Comfortabl!
comments  103$Staff were very acommodating. We booked it last minute as my mom fell ill and could not make the Eurostar back to London. Staff were gracious to split the double bed into two twins even though they were short on staff. That is what I call hospitality. Big bathroom and nice room overlooking Rue des Ecoles and pubs. Lobby is BB cozy with excellent background music.
comments  104$Stayed 9 nights. Superb staff - friendly and helpful! Always eager to listen to my request and handled them without any question with beautiful smiles! Superbly Clean - I am a germophobe. Every hotel room I go to, the first thing I do is to check the bedding and then I wipe every surface with white damp clothes. This was one of the rarest hotel rooms which I could not see any "black" dust stain on the cloth! Every surface was cleaned perfectly! Every single night, I could come back with joy that I can rest in the cleanest possible room in Paris. The new window blocks street noises completely. The room was rather small, but compared to other hotel rooms which my friends stayed, it was a palace. Overall, Fantastic stay. I felt happy from the moment I entered the hotel.
comments  105$Herşey harikaydı selamlar otel personeli
comments  106$Excelente hotel. Todos muito simpáticos. Recomendo.
comments  107$Le personnel était très serviable et très gentil. L’accueil fût excellent.
comments  108$Déplorable, tout le monde est souriant mais le service est absent, plus de nettoyage, oubli d'apport du petit-déjeuner, le codid a bon dos
comments  109$Séjour extraordinaire dans cette hôtel un service impeccable et radiné
comments  110$Le Novotel Les Halles est particulièrement bien situé (Metro Châtelet à 20m), la chambre 214 est spacieuse, le petit déjeuner complet et le personnel souriant, serviable et à l’écoute. Bémol sur le ménage (on nous a laissé 1 grosse flaque d’eau sous le lavabo). Mais, vraiment, c’est de l’ordre du détail.
comments  111$Le séjour dans cet hôtel a été merveilleux ! Le personnel est aux petit soin avec chaque client et les chambres et espaces communs sont spacieux . Emplacement idéal de l’hôtel pour visiter Paris ( tout est à proximité)
comments  112$Bien placé et gérant bien la situation COVID, l'accueil a été agréable et efficace. La chambre était très bien.
comments  113$Rien à redire. Tout était impeccable. Le seul bémol, l'environnement proche de l'hôtel, en travaux, et le petit passage couvert à côté de l’hôtel qui donne vers les Halles qui sert d'urinoir.
comments  114$Hôtel propre, calme même si le quartier est vivant et accueillant. Personnel attentionné. Petit-déjeuner parfait !
comments  115$Hotel bien situé au centre de Paris avec environnement sympa
comments  116$L’accueil... bien accueillis.pas d’éléments négatifs
comments  117$Le prix est surestimé par rapport aux autres hôtels de la même catégorie et aux prestations fournies. Très bon séjour. Le personnel est très professionnel et très agréable.
comments  118$Un beau séjour. L accueil était très très agréable et la situation de l hôtel nous a permis de rayonner dans tout Paris. Ce voyage était un cadeau réussi pour les 7 ans de ma petite fille.
comments  119$Très bon hôtel. Déjà mon 5 eme séjour dans cet hôtel
comments  120$Super bien situé. Super classe. Le buffet petit-déjeuner est vraiment très bien, il y a même un buffet pour les enfants avec des friandises. La chambre très bien hormis une petite fuite sur le flexible de la douche. Par contre même en étant au quatrième étage le bruit de la rue est quand même bien présent. Le double vitrage aurait-il un souci ? Le personnel était vraiment très bien et très souriant.
comments  121$Lavabo bouché Saleté Pas pris chambre 108 samedi soir Personnel pas concerné On est pris pour un numero
comments  122$Bel emplacement, personnel très accueillant, très bon confort et petit déjeuner excellent. A la hauteur des 4 étoiles. Pour une première visite dans cet hôtel tout a été parfait. Vives recommandations.
comments  123$Le personnel est très professionnel et très aimable. La chambre est petite et confortable. Le petit déjeuner est bien. Juste un regret : les "plats chauds" sont tièdes et il n'y a que deux machines à café, si bien qu'il faut faire la queue...
comments  124$Très bien, chambre confortable et moderne. Mais pour un 4* : pas de bouteille d'eau à disposition, pas de bloc note, pas de chaussons, et pas de piscine (alors qu'il y en a une au Novotel de la gare de Lyon).
comments  125$Proche de tout! Propreté . Bel accueil du personnel! Spacieux hall. Je le recommande pour ceux qui veulent visiter à pieds!
comments  126$Great room even if my floor choice i put as a comment when booking was not taken info account. Staff is overall Nice and welcoming with a few exceptions not friendly at all (room service). I don’t know why but strangely my in-room breakfast order left hanging outside the room was not delivered and after 2 days re-ordering by phone in the morning, they did not replace the order leaflet maybe for me not to use it anymore !
comments  127$Rien à dire sur le standing de l'hôtel : belles infrastructures avec un magnifique lobby, un patio intérieur agréable , une grande salle de restauration lumineuse pour le petit déjeuner qui est complet et excellent , des chambres confortables cocooning avec pour la mienne une jolie vue sur la canopée des Halles et l'église St Eustache . L'emplacement bien sûr est superbe tout proche de Rivoli , du marais , du forum des Halles et du Louvre . J'ai cependant un reproche à faire , en cas d'arrivée matinale , la politique de l'hotel est de faire payer un supplément de 70 euros si vous voulez la chambre plus tot , ce n'est pas très amical comparé à d'autres hotels ! un effort est à faire de ce côté !
comments  128$bon hôtel sans plus sans parking sur site et parking payant et assez élevé pour le prix
comments  129$Personnel très attentionné. Chambres très confortables et hôtel bien situé dans le centre de Paris.
comments  130$L’emplacement de cet hôtel est parfait! Accès à tous les transports en commun. Situé dans un Suberbe quartier avec de nombreux restaurants et café. Le personnel de l’hôtel offre un service remarquable. Soucieux de nous donner de bonnes recommandations afin de rendre notre séjour des plus agréable.
comments  131$au top pour les liaisons en metros pour toute la ville
comments  132$Hotel idéalement situé, confort général plus que satisfaisant, personnel attentif.
comments  133$Service à la clientèle hors pair. Lorsque nous avons oublié nos passeport sans le coffre-fort, puisque nous avions quitté Paris, le personnel a gardé le tout et nous les a fait livré a notre retour à l'aéroport de Paris la veille de notre départ.
comments  134$Hôtel très bien situé, dans le 1er arrondissement, à côté (30 secondes) du RER et du métro. Excellents services, chambre très propre et assez grande (pour Paris), confort toujours excellent. Très bon déjeuner - buffet. Cependant il ne s'agit pas d'un hôtel avec touche personnelle.
comments  135$C’est notre deuxième séjour dans cet hôtel et nous y retournerons avec grand plaisir, le personnel est exceptionnel et toujours à votre service, l’emplacement est idéal et la suite exclusive au 6eme étage avec une vue sur les toits de Paris est spacieuse et confortable
comments  136$Personnels très sympathique et compétent. Hôtel propre, très peu de bruit la nuit aux alentours. Machine à café nespresso pro en chambre et gratuit. Douche spatieuse. Hôtel situé à 30m du métro.
comments  137$accueil et propreté bien situé personnel agreable chambre confortable silenceuse
comments  138$Parfaite localisation, excellent petit déjeuner, chambre familiale avec une petite vue sur la Tour Eiffel. Excellente halte à Paris d’un jour, nous reviendrons au même hôtel une prochaine fois.
comments  139$Excellent location, good breakfast - more than we were expecting given covid measures. Would recommend as easy option for seeing all main sights and getting good nights sleep.
comments  140$Lovely personnel at reception. Smooth experience. For mistake charged instead of block from credit card 150 € but then refunded.
comments  141$Nice smart hotel in very good location. Staff were helpful and attentive. Bar prices a bit OTT so we drank out after our first night. Breakfast was very good, but we ate out for lunch and dinner. Room was smart although not as spacious as we thought it would be considering it was a superior room. Overall though we had a great stay and would stay there again.
comments  142$Hotel was ok, we stayed in a junior suite, I expected it to be a little nicer based on the reviews and ratings. Maybe it was just my room, but it could have used a little TLC. I parked in the Chatelet Les Halles underground parking area located immediately below the hotel level. The parking spaces were labeled Novotel reserved parking, but apparently they don’t belong to the hotel anymore? My luggage was taken sometime in the early morning; the hotel, parking company, and police were of no help.
comments  143$Hotel was wonderful and location was great . Staff was very helpful !
comments  144$We are from sudbury and could not go because of coronavirus and the risk of being stuck there in quarantine. The hotel or Expedia offered no refund of any kind given the circumstances. We did not wish to cancel our trip but given our safety of ours and our 7 year old we had to cancel and take the loss
comments  145$great location ! Hotel is wonderful very clean. Staff is amazing
comments  146$The Novotel Paris Les Halles was in the perfect location with a Metro stop right outside the main entry, plenty of bistros around and with shopping behind. Only two blocks from the Seine and the Louvre. The staff couldn’t have been nicer. Our trip was cut short a couple of days because of the travel ban but when we return to Paris one day, we’ll stay here again.
comments  147$This Hotel hits a home run in all categories. We picked the room with a view and king size bed. Extremely clean, staff is superb, location is incredible and the bed... omg the bed is the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on. The hotel is surrounded by shops and restaurants and faces an underground stop. One street over we were able to grab a bus that took us straight to the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre is in walking distance. I will definitely be staying here again.
comments  148$The hotel was in a great location, modern, clean. The staff was friendly. The breakfast buffet was a prefect way to start the day before sightseeing. There is a lot to do and see in the area.
comments  149$Nice hotel in nice area, but a few things really disappointed. Staff member easily walked in 2 hours after I checked in while I was sleeping without even knocking, rain water was leaking inside of the room while it was raining. Another confusion happened at the bar downstairs. But after all rooms are nice and clean.
comments  150$Great location, clean hotel, friendly and helpful staff at front desk.
comments  151$This hotel was wonderful. The mattresses were the most comfortable I ever slept on in a hotel and I travel a lot. The staff was helpful and most friendly and the room and hotel was very clean. It was a convenient walk to many attractions and metro stop as well as good restaurants. I highly recommend this hotel
comments  152$Brilliant location. Staff were great. Hotel very clean & comfy bed
comments  153$The temperature in the room was very warm and I could not get the room to cool down. Way too hot. Very uncomfortable.
comments  154$The lobby is beautiful. Nice staff, room is a bit dated.
comments  155$Friendly and welcoming receptionist. Great location, clean room
comments  156$Assez décevant pour un hotel 5*. C'est très vétuste et loin des photos présentées. Le prix est correct pour cette catégorie mais mériterait un coup de jeune. La machine a café marchait tres moyennement.
comments  157$Hôtel vieillissant, mais très propre. La salle de bain est vraiment trop petite. Ce studio pour 2 ne permet pas de l'utiliser à 2 ... Personnel attentif et efficace. Dommage que j'ai glissé sur le sol en bois mouillé en sortant : résultat, vêtement déchiré et genou douloureux le reste de mon voyage. La sécurité est à revoir de ce côté là !!
comments  158$Suite spacieuse, propre, attrayante.Personnel sympathique et aux petits soins.
comments  159$Mal renseigné sur la situation géographique de l’hôtel. Nous cherchions un hôtel à proximité de l’Arena. Lors de la réservation on nous indique 15minutes à pieds. Quelle fut pas notre surprise en constatant qu’il y avait plus de 30 minutes!! L’hôtel est en travaux et les entreprises commencent à travailler à 9h00 !!
comments  160$Staff very nice and friendly, suites spacious, I travelled with my dog, there was even a little welcome gift for it, we loved it :-)
comments  161$L'hôtel est en travaux donc pas de possibilité de prendre son petit déjeuner dehors. Des échafaudages devant la fenêtre de la chambre donc aucune vue.Nous aurions aimé avoir une réduction pour ce désagrément.
comments  162$La proximité avec est excellente. C’est dommage qu’un si bel établissement n’ai pas la vue Sur une partie de Paris !
comments  163$Belles prestations avec une équipe particulièrement accueillante et à l'écoute.
comments  164$Personnel accueillant, service à la hauteur mais manque convivialité : suggestions de prendre le petit déjeuner en salle libre service pour les clients. Accès pas facile aussi la première fois, galéré un peu avant de retrouver l'hôtel même avec le GPS. Satisfaite de mon séjour et recommanderais . A la prochaine Merci
comments  165$C'est mon 2e sejour dans ce charmant et magnifique Hotel en famille ou en solo, j'en suis satisfait, j'y reviendrai avec grand plaisir.
comments  166$Excellent hôtel. Conforme aux attentes. Moquette dans la suite tachée. Pourtant l’hotel a été rénové récemment. Taches sur la baignoire également mais propre. Tres bon accueil. Parking un peu cher pour une nuit. L’emplacement de l’hôtel ne permet pas de se garer à l’extérieur. Bon séjour dans cet hôtel malgré tout.
comments  167$Séjour super agréable. C'est toujours un plaisir de venir au Fraser... on se sent comme à la maison.
comments  168$Très bel hôtel, propre, confortable, calme ,petit déjeuner super bon, accueil très aimable !seul seul inconvenient vraiment très embêtant c est l emplacement, et la difficulté d arriver au parking, chose qu on devrait peut-être expliquer aux clients par un petit mail afin qu ils ne ratent pas l entrée, surtout que le petit chemin est à sens unique !et surtout que le GPS n amène vraiment et exactement au bon endroit ,et pour les gens qui connaissent pas, le nom de l hôtel qui n est indiqué nulle part sur la façade de l hôtel !juste un petit mail pour préciser tout ça est le bienvenue et les clients arrivent détendus et heureux .sinon très bon hôtel!mais je ne le recommanderai pas juste à cause de la difficulté d arriver au parking, surtout aux gens qui ne connaissent pas !
comments  169$It was a nice property, the staff was friendly and is very close to the train.
comments  170$It was good. The rooms are quite big, and the best part is they give you a separate kitchen
comments  171$Very comfortable stay. Mini apartment with everything you need. Metro super conveniently located.
comments  172$Le Defense is a wonderful area of Paris. Very metropolitan, lots of restaurants, very modern. If you want old world Paris, Le Defense is not the district for it but we needed the room and the kitchen so this is the perfect place for our family. The staff was great and most are multilingual and well versed in English but not the housekeeping staff, they are not bilingual at all but super polite. Uber or Taxi will be necessary for most tours and the Arc De Triumph is the best place to catch tours or to get your Uber or Taxi back to the hotel. That will cut down your Uber or Taxi costs.
comments  173$It was an enjoyable stay
comments  174$Very clean and spacious and close to the metro very well located
comments  175$The property is located near a train station. However, there are no eating places near the property. The services by the hotel are prompt and efficient.
comments  176$Everything was very nice. Sadly only stayed for one night. Checkin was easy and smooth. Kristie at the desk was very helpful. If I come back to Paris again in future I will definitely come back again.
comments  177$Apartment is good Parking is very bad (no enough parking, space very small)
comments  178$We enjoyed our stay. We had everything we needed except for an ATM machine. The subway was close by. There was food and shopping nearby.
comments  179$I love the feel of a home away from home and that is what it felt like. I booked the 1 bedroom and it was roomy and very comfortable. Location was great. A short walk to the metro ( a 2 minutes) and about a 10 minute walk to the Westfield mall. Also the metro and the RER have stops in the mall how great is that.
comments  180$Good place to stay Close to metro
comments  181$Staff are friendly , helpful and made my stay Easy and pleasant. Hotel location is awesome .
comments  182$Nice large suite with kitchen. Close to subway to city. In the business district, had parking in building. Clean and comfortable.
comments  183$The Fraser Suites are good for individuals working in La Défense area. They are not the best for families with kids as the rooms are tiny and the breakfast very basic. The grocery store is at least 30 mins walk one way. We had a two bedroom apartment and it had one bathroom which made it hard.
comments  184$Very courteous staff, clean environment and great room cleaning service, spacious rooms. Will recommend highly.
comments  185$Everything was nice about this property, staff were super nice and helpful, location was great, comfortable suites and clean. The only problem was Renovating the building which was little noisy. Will definitely go back again though.
comments  186$The property was under construction so it was a little bit difficult to locate. However, it was close to the La Defense Metro and easy to get around. The staff was very clear and concise and was very helpful. Also, the cell phone that the hotel provided for our family to use, was very a good surprise. Would book again.
comments  187$I booked a room to this 5 star hotel. Received a confirmation, then once on location, I was told the hotel was full and was transferred to another hotel. It turned out to be a 3 star hotel and was put in an old room, below standard.
comments  188$This property was wonderful! Nicely decorated; fresh flowers in common areas added warmth. The staff was helpful and friendly. We had questions before we arrived and the staff responded within a few hours. Our apartment was spacious and beds were comfortable. I would recommend this property to my friends and family.
comments  189$Great location, near 2 the Metro stops. Front reception crew were great to work with. Clara was very helpful and made our stay easy.
comments  190$The rooms are clean, quiet, and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially Clara. I would definitely stay here again. It's just a few minutes walk from the metro, the train station, and a shopping mall.
comments  191$The staff were nice and helpful the room was nice large and clean. If I had to say something it would be the carpet was stained but not even that was a problem it was all just really good. The area is near transportation and food places of which the staff is really nice and helpful as well at the nearby eateries. The location is sometimes concerning due to the fact many loiter about the front gate. Which many were nice and lovely but we had a few characters that for example followed us some time from the front gate made crude motions and comments towards one of the females in our group making another female in our group immediately ask to retreat back to the hotel because she no longer felt safe. They were out there every day of our stay day and towards the night hours. But that in no way was the places fault just something to watch out for.
comments  192$the location is great with only 2 min from metro station, very welcoming reception, smooth check in and out, our 2 bedroom apartment was great and cleaned on a daily basis. very happy and would go back again.
comments  193$The property was under renovation. There is only one toilet and bathroom in apartment. The staff was helpful.
comments  194$Proper English spoken, well communication, room also well maintained, only short coming is breakfast is always same, we eat 6 days same in a row.
comments  195$A perfect stay. To summarize it was a decent hotel with all amenities with no fancy entrance (which is a bit off from main road) adjacent to Novotel and ibis. Staff was very accommodating and cool. They took care of everything. we booked a family room with kitchen. All amenities were as described during the booking. Kids also enjoyed the stay. A five star from me. Nearest station with all superstores is La defense. You get all groceries, McD, marks and Spencer kinda stores etc at this station which is 5 minutes walk and one stop away from hotel.
comments  196$very comfortable place, clean friendly, good location
comments  197$The design of apartment is nice, equipments arevwell arranged.
comments  198$The property is located near the Metro station and it’s very accessible. The guest service is very attentive to all our request, only the property is under renovation.
comments  199$Property near Metro station, Kitchentte was stocked and useful.Pull out beds for children, Free laundry facility, Easy reservation & multi language speaking receptionists, Storage room What we didn't like : Neither expedia or hotel didnt mention in ad or email or anywhere that facility is going thru a renovation. We could smell the Dust & feel dust in air. Balcony were closed off for work - we closed off all curtains and never opened it. Work in building was only in specific hrs - but you could hear drilling noise if you are late in morning or come early back to hotel. Second is breakfast - No a la carte option and buffet breakfast was costly ($16 per head).
comments  200$This is great for families. Really safe and quiet with comfy beds and quick access to the best metro line.
comments  201$Perfect for a family of 5. We had everything we need and very spacious rooms.
comments  202$I stayed with family for one night. Only found the parking to be the downside as it really is hard to find even though staff had very kindly sent maps. The staff at the hotel is very helpful and friendly. The apartment was amazing we did have fantastic views but unfortunately the balcony was out of use because of building works. The place was clean and had all the useful amenities included. The Metro was just like few mins away. We really enjoyed our stay and would choose this hotel again
comments  203$Clean and spacious The toilet had no ventilation .
comments  204$Warmest welcoming from their GM and all staffs, willing to listen and helpful to our need. I like to recommend u all and hope to visit again soon 👍
comments  205$L' accueil est chaleureux, l'hôtel est décoré avec goût, le petit déjeuner est très agréable. C'est un endroit idéal pour s'évader une nuit ou deux, même quand on habite Paris.

comments  211$Séjour agréable, seul bémol odeur des cigarettes dans les couloirs voir même qui pénètre la chambre ce qui n’est pas évident pour une femme enceinte.
comments  212$Une seule nuit passée dans ce petit hotel cosy refait à neuf. Proche Gare de l'Est et Gare du Nord, ambiance et déco sympa, staff accueillant et bienveillant, chambre très bien équipée et décorée avec goût, bref, une belle surprise. J'y reviendrai a coup sûr.
comments  213$Pas d’eau chaude à notre arrivée et nous avions réservé la suite avec baignoire à jet ... on nous a assuré qu’il y aurai de l’eau chaude le lendemain mais il n’y avait toujours rien. En arrivant dans notre chambre, il y avait un masque usagé et un sac poubelle sur le détecteur de fumée ?! Pas très hygiène durant cette période de crise. Peu de choix au petit déjeuner. Le service était tout de même convenable. Merci à la dame qui servait le petit déjeuner, très serviable et agréable ! :)
comments  214$Séjour agréable, et personnel accueillant. Chauffage réglable et petit frigo. Quartier vivant mais c’est tres bien insonorisé j’ai tres bien dormi.
comments  215$
comments  216$Je n'ai passé qu'une nuit, tout était parfait! J'ai appelé la réception à 1 h du matin pour des voisins bruyants, moins de 5 mn après, plus rien: une telle réactivité est rare: Encore MERCI! Un super hôtel tout près de la gare de l'est!
comments  217$Chambre confortable et calme Accueil professionnel et chaleureux très apprécié
comments  218$Séjour d’une nuit, de passage à Paris.
comments  219$Grosse déception pour le petit déjeuner vu le prix. Plus de beurre, jus d'orange en bouteille, pas de fruits ou de salé. Pas de choix en pain... Ménage de la chambre non fait entre les deux jours. En période de COVID c'est limite...
comments  220$Déco au top. C tout neuf et très propre. Petit déjeuner très varié. Accueil sympathique.
comments  221$Hôtel top et superbe week-end à Paris en amoureux

comments  226$Hôtel de qualité, bien situé. Personnel adorable, accueil très agréable. Petit déjeuner génial avec des produits de qualité. Je reviendrai sans aucun doute lors de mes prochains voyages à Paris.
comments  227$Bien situé ,très bon déjeuner .service impeccable .chambre très propre.
comments  228$The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel room was cute and clean. There was also a nice breakfast!
comments  229$very good hotel - good prices
comments  230$I booked this for a friend travelling home to France during the COVID-19 period. She reports the hotel was welcoming, friendly, clean and comfortable. It is also close to the main Paris railway station, so very well positioned for travel.
comments  231$The hotel was great. Very cute decor. However the location was something to be desired. It’s close to the train station which is great for quick trips but further from tourist sites
comments  232$Very nice, neat and clean. Love the spacious toilet. The receptionist, Phalone, was very helpful. The only thing is that you could hear train underground if you’re a light sleeper.
comments  233$Clean rooms with what you need but a little on the small side. No bar to get drinks or anything in the hotel. Facilities not great in regards to accessibility getting up to rooms and in to the hotel (monitored) by reception. No tea or coffee facilities in room and very noisy at night meaning little sleep
comments  234$The location of the hotel was really convenient, and it met all our expectations. I really liked the decoration and the politeness of the stuff. Especially the guy who works at night shift was really helpful and friendly with us.
comments  235$Everyone and everything staff were very friendly and helpful and the whole time there was excellent would definitely recommend
comments  236$The hotel is in a good location, within 500 m of both Gare du Nor and Gare de l'Est. It reopened in 2019 after a full renovation and is in good condition. The rooms are simple but nice and the hotel decor and style is bright and friendly. All topped off by helpful staff and a decent continental breakfast.
comments  237$Cozy rooms, good breakfast, excellent WiFi, friendly staff
comments  238$Staff were very friendly and helpful. Location good. Nice rooms
comments  239$It was a lovely hotel, friendly staff, good service, clean, comfortable. Would have liked tea making facilities and a safe in room.
comments  240$Incredible service, they were all lovely and helped out straight away with any issues. The breakfasts were amazing and staff there were on point. Very very lovely experience
comments  241$We needed the hotel just as a base. It served the purpose well. A few minor things may need to be added and I would say it would receive a near-perfect score - no toilet brush, not enough toiletries for three people ( but Reception had some on hand), no complimentary tissues. Possibly through no fault of the hotel, we had to go through a day with one towel on hand - late delivery did not materialise and still unavailable in the morning.
comments  242$Rooms are very cute, and very well-designed and comfortable. The stairs are quite steep, narrow and turn sharply which can be challenging with big bags (there is a lift, but it stops "between" floors so you still need to go up or down a flight of stairs to get to the room)
comments  243$Uitermate netjes., nieuw hotel. Goede ligging, vlakbij Gare d’Est / metro’s. Niet gehorig. Goede bedden. Gewenst: koffiezetter op de kamer.
comments  244$Leider gab es kein Kleiderschrank und auch keinen Tisch zum sitzen.
comments  245$Sehr sauber, klein und charmant. In unserem Zimmer gab es keinen Schrank, was das Wäschesortieren etwas kompliziert gestaltet hat. Die Fenster halten den Lärm von außen nur bedingt ab. Nach 23:00 auch von außen leise.
comments  246$Everything was great! I have been to 4-star hotels that were not even close to being so good as Hotel Lucien et Marinette. Everything was clean and stylish. I reallly liked the decoration of the rooms. The hotel is close to two railway stations and within walking distance to Montmartre and Louvre - we did walk to both from the hotel. The personal was very friendly and helpful. We did not have breakfast there, so I cannot judge that. All in all, we had a really pleasant stay there! We would be happy to stay there again next time.

comments  255$Séjour d’affaires
comments  256$Pas ouf les femmes de ménage font seulement le ménage lors du départ les chambre sont minuscules et la douche aussi l’asanceur
comments  257$Hotel confortable et propre. Les chambres sont mal insonorisées et on écoute tous les bruits des voisins. Dommage. Pour dormir seulement est tres bien.
comments  258$Hotel plus que correct pour un weekend dans la capitale. Très bon rapport quailté/prix! Etablissement propre, personnel accueillant et serviable, chambre confortable et petit déjeuner correct (avec pain et croissant frais). Emplacement pratique, proche rue de la Roquette et métro Bastille à 3mn à pieds. Seuls petits bémols, faible insonorisation et chambre un peu petite. Mais nous sommes dans Paris!

comments  262$Hôtel bien placé, chambre propre et confortable, prix intéressant. L'isolation phonique est moyenne.
comments  263$Pour ce prix à Paris c’est correct, mais il faut pas s’attendre à grande chose. À la limite juste pour une nuit pour dépanner
comments  264$Chambre propre avec TV et autres services mais nous avons vu une souris dans le couloir et le réceptionniste avait l'air surpris, ma fille de 2 a's avait peur de marcher dans ce couloir de plus, il n y a pas de parking et on sait que les places de parking à Paris sont difficiles à trouver. Je recommande si vous n'êtes pas véhiculé et que vous venez sans enfant pour quelques jours...
comments  265$hotel bien placé à proximité de tout
comments  266$Hôtel bien placé géographiquement chambre propre cartier anime
comments  267$Très bon accueil, personnel très gentil, propreté impeccable. Le point négatif c’est l’isolation des chambres. On sentait l’air à travers les fenêtres malgré les rideaux et impossible de dormir avant 5h du matin dû au bruit extérieur. Merci quand même pour votre accueil Cordialement
comments  268$Chambre toute petite. Télévision petite mal orientée, inutilisable. Wifi ne fonctionne pas. Salle de bain capsule avec rideau de douche toile = non hygiénique.
comments  269$Hôtel très propre, petite chambre et petite salle de bain. Petit déjeuner très minimaliste... Personnel très accueillant.

comments  272$Petit hotel sympa près du metro bastille. quartier animé. Petit ascenseur et petit déjeuner bien servi. Seule remarque, chambre simple très petite
comments  273$hôtel à qq minutes de l'opéra bastille donc bon point ; par contre , chambre ultra petite et lit trop dur !!! la clim n'étant pas encore en service , j'ai supporté les 25 degrés minimum toute la nuit car impossible d'ouvrir la fenêtre à cause du bruit dans la rue en dessous jusqu'à 6 heures !!! de toute façon le soleil tapait direct sur les vitres ! pourquoi ne pas vérifier et fermer les rideaux occultants ?? de plus j'ai été coincée dans l'ascenseur et personne ne s'est manifesté pour voir comment j'allais ensuite ! soirée gâchée car hausse de tension tellement j'ai flippé ! et donc j'ai dû monter et descendre à pieds les 3 étages ... chambre du coté rue avec bruits nocturnes incessants à EVITER
comments  274$Chambre correcte mais odeur assez désagréable (désodorisant sur odeur de cigarette). Chambre côté cour non bruyante
comments  275$Chambre très propre, literie confortable. Petit déjeuner correct (1 croissant, un peu de baguette, jus de fruits, fruits, compte, yaourt). Bon accueil.

comments  277$très bien placé, propre, literie confortable, bon accueil
comments  278$Chambre minuscule et très sale surtout au niveau de la douche. Une odeur de toilette désagréable. Chambre très mal isolé on entends tout les voisins et surtout la rue qui est très animée. Par contre situation parfaite pour découvrir le quartier. Personnel pas très agréable.
comments  279$Je ne sais je ne suis pas allé
comments  280$La chambre etait tres bien. Le seul point negatif c'est cette odeur de colle entêtante dû à des travaux à un autre étage. Lee petit déjeuner pourrait être étoffé.
comments  281$Tres beau séjour a cette hotel nous avons bien aimer
comments  282$convenient location, close to metro, bus, train. lots of restaurant, bars, bakery, market nearby. I know that it is for security purpose but you need to leave your key at the counter every time you leave the hotel.
comments  283$Small room but nice place and good location near the city centre
comments  284$Pleasant clean room in a good location near two metro stations.
comments  285$The Manager is really friendly and helpful !
comments  286$My family and I really enjoyed our stay here! Fresh pillows, towels, and other necessities were provided daily. Air conditioning worked perfectly as well. Also, I really enjoyed that they have an elevator (even though it’s tiny) because not many hotels in the area have elevators. Our room was super modern-looking, it looks way better than it did in photos! Beds were also very comfortable. Front desk person was always there 24/7, which made me feel safe! And on top of everything, the location is amazing! There are lots of restaurants, markets, and small shops that are only a few steps away. Would definitely stay here again. We had absolutely no problems at this hotel!
comments  287$Great location in Bastille but extremely minimal accommodations. We needed 3 twin beds in one room which is harder to find, and it worked well for that. The bathroom/shower feels like a boat bathroom and is tiny, even for comparable European standards. There is no lighting in the stair way on the lower floor and it's almost impossible to see. If you are looking for the most basic accommodations in an area that is awesome for food, walking places, etc - it's decent. But keep your expectations realistic. Staff nice and kind.
comments  288$Location is convenient and close to metro station as well as the Marais neighbourhood. Staff were ok. Overall condition of the hotel (rooms, hallways, even staircase etc) rather disappointing. Definitely overpriced - not worth staying here. We have been regularly visiting Paris since 2008 and this was easily the worst hotel we have stayed at.
comments  289$the toilet/shower was really small like in a ship... price is a lot for what you get
comments  290$Good location, plenty of bars, restaurants and cafes in the local area, and close to two Metro stations for access into Paris. The hotel was fine, we booked a triple room which was a bit on the small side and cramped for three people.
comments  291$Rooms are really small but clean. Fantastic if you are alone or travelling light. Extremely close to Bastille station. And down the street from indi designers and watering holes. Has a lift!
comments  292$The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We stayed 3 to a room, which wasnt too cramped. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. We only really stayed at the hotel to sleep, so it is perfect if you are looking for a place to sleep. I would reccommend to a friend.
comments  293$Excellent place to stay in Paris Nice area & easy accessible to metro Extreme friendly staff & very helpfull
comments  294$Very nice staff. Room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. Very close to the metro station. Eateries, bars, and convenient stores at door step.
comments  295$It was a great stay overall, and it was a long one. It is definitely not a fancy place and the room was very basic but it was ok. They cleaned every day, brought fresh towels and if you need anything you can always ask reception. Everyone was very nice at the hotel and I felt very comfortable and felt secure, I was traveling solo. Being summer in Paris it gets very hot, but the room had air conditioning which was great. Elevator is very small but no real problem with it. Even though it is very basic, it is worth the money, the Bastille area where it is located is awesome, lots of restaurants and cafes, like a block away from the metro line 1 which is the one that will take you to all the main attractions and very very near to Le Marais, which is a very trendy nice area in Paris (and a lot more expensive to stay in) where you can hang out and even do some shopping. I will go back and stay there next year most likely.
comments  296$Great neighborhood! Super friendly staff. Amazingly comfortable beds. Rooms are small, but do the trick. We had a 4 man with a queen/double bed and two twin beds. Convenient to the metro, bars, and restaurants.
comments  297$Good location. Small clean room and bathroom. Safe did not work Initially told we could not have the air-conditioning on but after 2 nights it was put on - much improved our stay.
comments  298$Room was tiny but clean and comfortable, bit noisy and have a great area close by for food and Metro is 1 block away
comments  299$Второй раз во Франции - решили расположиться восточнее, около пл.Бастилии. Расположение - супер. Администраторы русскоговорящие - супер. Не повезло с забастовками и метро - не супер. Приехали уставшие с рождественской ночи из Страсбурга и нас заселили раньше времени в наш номер, большое спасибо за этот жест, номер чистый и приятный. Крутой лифт! Стены не очень толстые, соседей было слышно, ну и проходящих за дверью из-за щели под входной дверью, особенно кричащих бесцеремонных китайцев, которые не уважают чужой покой и перекрикиваются на своё языке с разных концов коридора. Душевая кабина удобная, немного была продавлена кнопка на унитазе, приходилось поправлять чтобы не журчала вода.
comments  300$väldigt litet rum och sjukt liten hiss. bra för nära vänner kanske
comments  301$J’y retournerai avec beaucoup de plaisir👍😊
comments  302$Tout était super emplacement propreté .seul bémol chambre vraiment petite
comments  303$Nous avons été pleinement satisfaits de notre chambre. Personnel accueillant souriant et disponible nous avions chambre propre et bien équipée. Proche du métro et de la gare SNCF, c'est une bonne adresse pour un séjour dans la capitale. A recommander.
comments  304$Point positif Très bon accueil, literie confortable, propreté sans reproche, rénovation récente, petit déjeuner très correct. Excellent rapport Qualité/prix Accès douche vraiment étroit.

comments  306$Excellente situation. Optimisation de l'espace dans la chambre. Décoration très sympa. Personnel charmant.
comments  307$Très bon rapport qualité prix. Hôtel bien placé : à la fois proche de plusieurs métros et dans une rue calme. Accueil 24/24 avec personnel sympathique. Point négatif : douche froide le matin (mais pas le soir) !
comments  308$Hôtel très bien place et personnel très serviable. En revanche les chambres sont minuscules et ne permettent pas d'y travailler le soir. Petit déjeuner sympa

comments  313$Petit hôtel sympathique pour un week-end parisien, dans une rue assez calme.
comments  314$Service parfait, chambre propre et confortable. Bon accueil !
comments  315$Our stay was wonderful! The staff went above and beyond to help us with! The staff really are great in helping their guest. The room was very clean and just an awesome place to stay. Only a block from the metro.
comments  316$Great location, convenient, friendly staff, fairly big rooms for a 2 stars hotels in Paris. Talking about stars, this was much better than some of 3 stars hotels I've stayed at. The breakfast is good and generous, but always the same everyday (I would have appreciated some variations during my 4 nights stay). But will definitely stay there again when travelling to Paris.
comments  317$Great location and cute rooms.
comments  318$any hotel that want yo charge me for two small bottle of water, if a place i would never go back to , the room were tiny but clean
comments  319$Smaller room than expected but overall we had a good stay, the hotel is more less in a good location, few blocks from Gard North train station. Staff was always friendly.
comments  320$Great little room which was perfect for a couple night stay. Everything was clean, room was comfortable, modern, and easy to check in and out. Location was great with many little shops, a grocery, restaurants, and metro right around the corner. For the price, we were very pleased.
comments  321$Great location right across street from A Holy Belly restaurant. Rooms are very very small! Bathroom is even smaller however the room was very clean. Bed was comfortable and staff was very friendly. Ask for an extra pillow on checkin - the pillows in the room are pretty flat. We didn’t use restaurant but the breakfast smelled yummy!
comments  322$We enjoyed our stay here. The room is very modern (although small), with a very comfortable bed and good windows that blocked out the noise from outside. Breakfast was filling and tasty. A short walk to Republique metro from where you can access most of Paris. Some great bars and restaurants in the area too. Would stay again.
comments  323$Very cute, standard, no frills European hotel room. Location is extremely convenient to get around the city with close proximity to the metro. As expected, small room and tiny bathroom. But both were kept very clean and everything was in great working condition. Hotel staff are super friendly and eager to help if needed.
comments  324$I loved the location. The staff was nice and the breakfast was very basic but good. The room was clean, and has all things I needed for the day. I would recommend this place to others
comments  325$Really small, funky room. Bathroom was so tiny that dropping the soap in the shower was a challenge. I purchased the breakfast option and paid in CDN$ before we arrived. That was a great choice as the breakfast served was amazing. There was enough food left over to take with us for lunch. The staff were wonderful, stored our bags on our last day so we could wander Paris freely. The hotel is located in a lesser known area of Paris, and there is a Metro station around the corner, so getting around Paris was easy. I would stay at this hotel again.
comments  326$I stay for one night with my girlfriend we find the hotel top I would be back . Keep the standard high because you are doing a fabulous job
comments  327$Excellent location - close to everything - especially with the scooters and walking 20K per day!
comments  328$We chose a larger room for 2 people and it was fine compared to our son's which was smaller but just one person. The staff at the desk were super helpful and spoke English well. We enjoyed our stay . There are many really good restaurants with in walking distance. The Holly Berry across the street was excellent for breakfast. It was very close to the subway entrance.
comments  329$The standard room was quite small, even by Paris standards. The bathroom door was right next to the bed, so not much privacy. It felt a bit like an airplane bathroom. However, the room was clean and the air conditioning worked. It is a no-frills, basic hotel, but you get what you pay for. We were fine with it for a cheap couple's weekend getaway and didn't have any major issues with the room or service. Not a particularly glamorous neighborhood but not seedy either. Walking distance to Gare du Nord, Metro, Le Marais, with a Carrefour convenience store and a decent bakery and brunch options on the same street. One of the best dinners we had was within walking distance at Au P'tit Curieux.
comments  330$It's a nice cozy hotel, clean and located around a lot of restos, grocery and bakeries. Also near metro subway.
comments  331$Both the hotel and the staff were great. It is in a great location within reasonable walking distance of many top attractions. This will be our hotel of choice anytime we are in Paris.
comments  332$Small room. Personnel very kind. Very clean. Near thw metro
comments  333$Rooms are renovated and look new. A/C is very cold, so it was great to cool off after museums. The staff was very helpful when my Uber driver canceled and made sure I was able to get to Louvre. Check-in was smooth and front desk made sure I had a map and had my bearings. Close to underground. Make sure you download RATP application to navigate underground so you don't get lost.
comments  334$Clean cozy room with small nook between the bed and the bathroom / shower. Bed was firm and shower was refreshing. Air condition was a big plus along with the window / sky light. Location is great.
comments  335$This location was perfect for us! Loved having air conditioning and the breakfast was wonderful!
comments  336$The staff was always present and ready to help. Especially the young Indian man he was my favorite
comments  337$Clean, but could improve Near train station (gare de l’est) Rooms are small just like any other hotel in Paris it’s closed to restaurant and pubs I would recommend for a few nights or if you are traveling solo Overall was good
comments  338$Nice environment, grocery in front of property, restaurants nearby, metro station within 2 minutes walk.
comments  339$Excellent hotel in a wonderful neighborhood, near two metro stations. Friendly and smiley staff. We had the standard double room. It was not a large room (it's Paris we're talikng about) but its architecture was quite ergonomic. We could hear some noise from the street, but it didn't really bother us. Many cafes and restaurants around the area and a supermarket across the street. It's for sure that we'll visit it again.
comments  340$Very good value for money, clean room and well stocked
comments  341$The District Republique is within a couple minute walk to the nearest metro station, which is your primary form of transportation in Paris. My hotel room was newly renovated and modern with everything you'll need for your stay. However, the bathroom and the shower share the same space, and every time you shower, some water splashes onto the floor where the sink is (not a deal breaker though). Overall a nice stay, with the front desk available 24/7. They also speak English, which is a plus for foreign travelers!
comments  342$Staff is very welcoming and happy to show tourists decent places to visit. They also speak English very well. They are very helpful and this place is “ if you don’t ask you don’t get” sort of place. If you need/want something or are unhappy with something, say it! So they can see what they can do for you. Rooms are very small however, they are clean and modern. Breakfast is very basic and not worth the price if I’m honest. I would recommend going somewhere else for it. Location is very good and close to amenities.
comments  343$Front desk was especially friendly and helpful. Thank you!
comments  344$Great location, close to great cafes and restaurants, very very clean and comfortable, a little small but that us normal for Paris.
comments  345$This hotel was in a nice location. Close to restaurants grocery stores and the metro
comments  346$Nice affordable hotel close to the metro Room small but well equipped, kettle, hair dryer etc etc
comments  347$Room was small but clean, quiet and comfortable. Excellent location, one block from the metro and about one kilometer from Gare du Nord. A little awkward not having a nightstand (the bed was wedged between one wall and the closet, but otherwise very comfortable and we had a very nice four-day stay there. We didnt eat the breakfast, but there was a coffee/tea kettle in the room, which we used every morning. We would definitely stay there again.
comments  348$While small hotel rooms are typical in Paris, District République provides outstanding cleanliness, courteous staff, safety, and convenience to metro for attractions. Additionally, the air-conditioning allowed for extra comfort at night.
comments  349$The hotel was in a cute location just north of Plaza Republique. The room was tiny--it made a cruise ship room seem spacious. But they have everything positioned to take as much advantage of the space as possible. You also have an electric kettle, which is a nice touch. Our biggest problem was the intense smell of smoke. Every time we came into the room after being out, it would smell as though someone had just finished a cigarette in our room. We complained several times, but it never stopped. The hotel made a big deal about being non-smoking, but people were clearly smoking in the hallway or stairwell or something. They should just install real smoke alarms so that people won't smoke inside.
comments  350$I had a great experience at this hotel. The hotel staff from the front desk to housekeeping were really nice and outgoing. The staff was fluent in English and went out of their way to help with directions and tips. The room was spotless clean and appeared to have gone through a complete remodel recently. The neighborhood is a busy location close to markets, bakeries, and restaurants. The Jacques Bonsergant metro stop is about a minute away from the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel, it is a great spot to stay at a very reasonable price.
comments  351$localisation parfaite ! les prestations sont très bien pour un 2*. Les chambres sont propres. Parfait pour un séjour d'une nuit ou deux maximum.
comments  352$Chambre tres correcte, Salle de bain propre et rénovée, bonne literie. Accueil agreable, espace de vie a l'entree accueillant. Chambre silencieuse côté cour. Bon séjour.
comments  353$Trop bruyant. Chambres exigues.
comments  354$Pas de téléphone dans la chambre pour appeler la réception. Pas d'eau chaude !!! Mis à part le personnel accueillant et serviable !
comments  355$Très bon hôtel, dans un ancien bâtiment renouvelé il reste confortable un peu du bruit la nuit mais ça va, il est très bien situé près d’arc de triomphe et des ambassades, j’ai voyagé pour faire des démarches à l’ambassade d’Argentine et était parfait pour moi à 200 m de là-bas, les employés sont aimables et les chambres propres, le lit très confortable aussi, un peu cher mais ça vaut la peine Par la proximité aux endroits typiques de paris
comments  356$Établissement propre mais trop cher (>140€) compteQ-tenu de la sobriété de la chambre
comments  357$Bien placé proche des champs Elysées, rapport qualité prix très correct. Chambre très propre.
comments  358$Excellent emplacement Bon petit déjeuner Chambre et salle de bains très petites Propreté parfaite Accueil par diverses personnes agréable Ascenseur en demi étage qui nécessite de monter ou descendre quelques marches. Un peu bruyant sur la rue Manque un rideau blanc dans les chambres pour éviter que les personnes de l’immeuble en face ne vous voient par contre rideau nuit parfait.
comments  359$Hotel propre, simple Pour un passage que d'une nuit cela nous a convenu. Chambre petite mais très bien car nous venions juste pour dormir
comments  360$Hôtel bien placé juste à côté de la tour Eiffel. Personnel sympathique. Manque d'hygiène sans salle de bain (on a retrouvé un rasoir et il y avait des tâches suspectes dans la baignoire). Bonne literie et hôtel calme. Les photos de site de l'hôtel ne sont pas vraiment identiques à la réalité : chambres petites et décoration vieillotte.
comments  361$Très déçue de la chambre que j’ai trouvé plus petite que sur les photos, à part ça la literie est très bien, la salle bain assez petite, pas d’armoires ni de tiroirs, la douche assez petite aussi on met rapidement de l’eau partout. Manque de communication entre les employés qui m’ont redemandé de payer alors que j’avais déjà réglé dès mon arrivé! Bien dans l'ensemble malgré tout mais je ne séjournerai plus dans cet hôtel.
comments  362$Calme propreté .personnel aimable .sejour très satisfaisant.bien situé.

comments  366$Chambre d’hôtel très petite pour 3 personnes
comments  367$Le rapport qualité prix est tres moyen. Lhotel est correct mais un peu cher par rapport a d'autres de meme qualité
comments  368$Très bien placé dans le 16 à côté de la place Victor Hugo Gros problème dans cet hôtel : les demis étages dont je n’avais pas’ connaissance ! En sortant de l’ascenseur avec ma grosse valise c’était assez compliqué de redescendre a pieds déjà que les escaliers sont étroits
comments  369$très bien placé, chambre confortable et bonne salle de bain.
comments  370$Bon accueil, hôtel très bien placé. Chambre petite mais tout y est et c'est propre
comments  371$Over all just awesome Service, great location and amazing staff! We will definitely be back and recommend it to family and friends. Thank you!
comments  372$The room is extremely tiny. An 18-inch luggage can barely get in. There's literally no room to move in the shower room - you turn around your body you hit the shower room door. And this is 120 euros per night.
comments  373$Check in was great, check out wasn’t good. The gentleman who checked us out must be the owner of Paris or something... his customer service skills need improvement.
comments  374$The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was clean, but was very small. I mean hardly any room between the wall and bed kind of small. The room didn't have anything to make tea or coffee inside of it. There also wasn't a secondary lock from the inside. Since there wasn't much room we ended up shoving our luggage against the door to secure it anyway. I thought all of this might be usual considering it was Paris, but we stayed at a different hotel on our travels home and it had everything one would expect from a hotel stay.
comments  375$The room was small however it was very clean and comfortable and enjoyable. The staff were very helpful, professional and friendly. 👍
comments  376$Rooms are extremely small (definitely not like the pictures shown. The elevator wasn’t working and we had to go up the narrow stairs with our luggage.
comments  377$Everything very old, furniture, etc. Elevator bad.
comments  378$Cosy, clean, convenient location for central Paris
comments  379$Pictures dont tell the truth. We didnt see the lovely garden or any amenities that are advertised for this hotel The alleyway was too small to even walk straight Bathroom was so small that I struggled to even stand in it Not recommended
comments  380$Hjälpsam personal. Bra läge.
comments  381$Super Lage, nur wenige Minuten von der Champs Elysees oder dem Eifelturm entfernt!
comments  382$Bien recibidos, solo ingles o frances la atencion pero amables, el lugar huele micho a cigarrillo pero estaba limpio y comoda la cama.
comments  383$Hotellet har en enkel standard. Rommene er renslige og sengene gode. Som i mange andre hoteller i Paris er rommene ganske små, så for meg hadde det ikke passet å dele dette rommet med noen :-) Hotellet har derimot bra opplegg for WIFI, så her får du en rask linje om du trenger å jobbe. Lokalområdet er fantastisk, midt imellom Triumfbuen og Eiffeltårnet. Mange cafeer og restauranter.
comments  384$Hotel super bem localizado, perto de tudo! Local muito tranquilo. Hotel pequeno, e simples!!! Quartos confortáveis,muito limpos, roupa de cama impecável, não tem ar condicionado. Ótimo custo beneficio, pra que passa o dia rodando e fica no hotel para dormir.
comments  385$
comments  386$Muy pequeño todo y no tienen aire acondicionado, las maletas hay que subirlas por gradas de caracol
comments  387$Rent hotell med vänlig personal. bodde på femte våningen så trapporna gav motion... Hissen var mycket liten, men fungerade. Tvåbäddsrummet mycket litet, men klanderfritt rent liksom badrum. Skjutdörr in till badrummet gav ingen ljudisolering. Wifi bra och TV fungerade.Området där hotellet låg var lugnt , nära till restauranger och inga störande ljud. Ett hotell som passar den som är där när man sover. Rent, trevligt, ärligt men litet.
comments  388$grazioso! posto al pochi metri dalla metro e dal centro
comments  389$Solo estuvimos una noche con mi esposa. La habitación muy reducida, el baño súper pequeño sobre todo el área de ducha. Por el precio esperaba algo mejor. La ubicación muy buena, a 5 minutos caminando del Arco del Triunfo y de la estación del metro o RER.

comments  405$L'hôtel est bien placé, près du métro et des commerces. Notre chambre etait petite mais très propre, en très bon état et fonctionnelle. En revanche l'accueil a été désastreux (le réceptionniste a refusé de faire le check-in tant que mon compagnon n'était pas là car c'est lui qui avait fait la réservation - une heure d'attente). De plus L'hôtel est mal insonorisé.

comments  421$Très bon WE dans cet hôtel, à 2 pas d’en l’Arc de Triomphe. Propre, confortable et avec un petit déjeuner gratuit qui vaut largement certains petits déjeuners payants de certains établissements.
comments  422$très bon accueil, seul et unique souci : ne pas prendre son petit déjeuner trop top. Le reste est parfait
comments  423$D'habitude je mets des remarques plutôt positives sur cet hôtel , mais au cour de ce dernier séjour ,il m'a été attribué une chambre minuscule avec vue sur une cour intérieure au 1er étage ... catastrophique!
comments  424$Hôtel très agréable. Chambre donnant sur rue calme. Bon quartier sur et pratique. Chambre confortable, bonne literie. Salle de bain propre. L'équipe masculine à l'accueil pas toujours agréable,ni efficace, souvent débordée au téléphone alors qu'on patiente en face pour le Check out avec avion à prendre.

comments  429$Cette hôtel est catastrophique j’ai déjà mis un avis sur votre site il y a peu de temps : chambre minuscule, lit collé au mur, salle de bain où on ne peut accéder à la cuvette des toilettes tellement l’espace avec la douche est étroit (et je suis petite j’imagine Un homme de 1,85 m) et les employés sont détestables, pas aimables du tout surtout les hommes, la moquette est sale, il n’y a aucun rayonnage pour poser des vêtements ou affaires ni dans la salle de bain ni dans la chambre, etc. Je ne le conseille pas

comments  435$Nous avons passé un excellent séjour. Hotel très propre et très confotable, en plus du déjeuner avec une grande variété. Par contre, aucune machine à glace et aucune glace disponible, un peu surprenant pour un hotel.
comments  436$Hôtel très agréable et très bien situé pour découvrir Paris
comments  437$Very nice and clean and in a great location. The breakfast was very good.
comments  438$Excellent location. Front desk staff was great! Room was great!!! The only thing I didn’t like was that the lady in charged of the breakfast was very rude!
comments  439$Good, clean, friendly and reliable price for hotel and breakfast included.
comments  440$Friendly welcome at the hotel. Rooms as expected were small. Unfortunately even though it was January the rooms were uncomfortably warm. Put air-con on with little effect. Breakfast was great, enough choice for everyone. Location was excellent, plenty of bars/restaurants around, and easy to get to the sites and transport. Would stay again, thank you
comments  441$small room, but practical and quiet
comments  442$Vaccation
comments  443$It was walking distance to the center of the city: Arc de Triomphe!
comments  444$Rooms are updated but very small. TV had a large scratch on the screen. If you have more than one bag of luggage, you will struggle with space. Not allowed to bring food to the room... I got yelled at by the staff because I was bringing my sick girlfriend breakfast. Great location, but I would not go back.
comments  445$Friendly staff, clean rooms, good WiFi and very good breakfast in the morning. Staff were successful in meeting my need for an early check-in which is a big plus from my side. Rooms are relatively small but I guess that this is kinda typical in Paris.
comments  446$Excellent location! Property is older and the rooms need some TLC. The staff is great and the breakfast which is included had an excellent selection for all.
comments  447$We were charged for a bottle of water despite telling we did not use it.staff didn't wish us when we checked out .They were more concerned about 2.50 euros.Also staff was irritated when I requested bread which ran out at 9 am although breakfast was till 10 and couldn't understand why this unfriendly attitude. Is this how Parisians treat their guests??
comments  448$Close to tourist attractions and food. Lovely rooms and bathrooms. The staff were very helpful.

comments  456$chambre calme et confortable; salle de bain un peu petite
comments  457$Petit hôtel à deux pas de la Madeleine, très bien placé. Les chambres Premium sont vraiment grandes pour Paris , le bureau permet de travailler, le canapé de lire. Neuf, propre, literie excellente, bon accueil souriant. J'y reviendrai à l'occasion avec plaisir. Excellent rapport qualité prix pour Paris et la situation.
comments  458$Un hôtel cosy, au calme en plein centre de Paris, des boutiques. Le personnel adorable. À conseiller sans hésitation.
comments  459$Bon séjour à Paris grâce à l'accueil, au confort de l'hôtel et surtout à sa situation

comments  467$Good hotel in a good location
comments  468$Arrived at 10pm at the hotel to find it was closed for COVID reasons. I had not been informed at all. Really was not impressed. Thankfully was referred to another hotel around the corner which was vaguely expecting us - i think - although they didn't seem sure for a moment. Not impressed with Hotels.com either for not informing that the hotel was closed and i would have to stay elsewhere.
comments  469$It’s maintained and clean but only a small lift that fit 2 person and 2 luggage
comments  470$We did not get the correct room the first night. Room 502 we booked a luxury room it was very small and smelled like smoke. We said we did not get the correct room the next night moved us to room we purchased 503 which was a luxury room this isn’t right
comments  471$It is a good location for shopping and is walkable (25 mins) to the Louvre or has metro nearby, as long as there's no strike!
comments  472$Location Excellent Service & Staff Breakfast buffet
comments  473$All of the personnel are friendly and helpful, but I would like to single out Sara at reception. She was very helpful to me the day I arrived in locating my Paris Museum Pass. She is smart, efficient, and pleasant, and she shows initiative in solving problems for the guests.
comments  474$Very pleasant, clean, well-appointed room and kind staff. I would happily stay there again.
comments  475$Nothing bas at all, property spaces are very limited as usuall in Europe. Very good location.
comments  476$A gem of a hotel. Stayed 4 nights and everything and everyone were perfect. Location to Metro Madeleine, around the corner and hotel on a side street off the main road Tronchet was very quiet. Grocery store, restaurants and bakery (yummy croissants) were 2 to 5 doors on either side of hotel. Thanks to all the staff who made our stay memorable.
comments  477$Staff really lovely and helpful even though I was working. . I like all the food options there especially since I didn’t want to eat bread / cheese anymore. Close to metro and quiet.
comments  478$I booked for the wrong night and they refused to forego the charge, or even a part of it. Otherwise, the room was very comfortable and quiet.
comments  479$From the check in time to check out the staff was very helpful special the manager.
comments  480$Great location central to everything we wanted to see (Louvre, Orsay Museum, Arc of Triumph, Eiffel Tower, located in Opera district. We were promised two twin beds and only received two twin beds. Very unhappy about that. We had a private bathroom, AC, non-smoking, close to metro, average price was about $170/night, breakfast for the price you couldn't beat (15 euro), but the wifi was frustrating, it would time you out every 10-15 minutes. Horrible.
comments  481$This would be what i sum one ofthe best hotel for its range, from the moment we check in, we have been greeted and served well, to the rooms which are much bigger than the usual crampy Parisian size. Its room deco is not old and outdated too, very up to date and kept well clean. Walli and Freddie have been very welcoming and helpful, and has lived up to my high expectations of a good service. We actually checked out and had been sitting at the lobby as our train departs late around 9pm, so we were able to see every the 2-3 hour period when we're there. The front desk really welcomes each and every guest amazingly with their positive vibes, and helping out the Italian, Australian, Japanese and also Chinese who were brimming with joy during checkin. Would definitely stay here again my next trip. Kudos!
comments  482$The location is very good... close to champ elysee, Eiffel Tower and concorde square, as well as to shopping pplaces like gallery la fayette
comments  483$Very elegant older hotel in the Mediane/Opera area of Paris. The Room as noted in he photo was very nice.
comments  484$We had an issue on checkin that was was dealt with in a prompt and positive way. The staff was amazing and helpful. We would Recommend!
comments  485$The lady in the front desk was very friendly and helpful with information and directions in getting to our destinations.
comments  486$I go to Paris twice a year and always love to stay in the 3 hotels near the Madeleine area. This was my first stay in Best Western Folkestone Opera and I have to stay it is one of the best. The room is vert clean, tastfully decorated and very comfortable. I stayed for four nights and I found all the staffs are very friendly, polite and helpful. The manager, was super nice to upgrade us to a Deluxe room where we can relax in a more spacious room with a nice separate sitting area with a big sofa and coffee table. There are free coffee and tea provided in the lobby so you can take a good rest after a long day of shopping. The neighbourhood has lots of small cosy restaurants and there are two grocery shops. I enjoyed my stay last time will come back to stay next time for sure.
comments  487$Nice staff ever....clean , near metro, good location
comments  488$Good location for shopping and going out, but still hotel is in a quiet street. helpfull staff at reception. Room was comfortable. Breakfast was ok.
comments  489$Our overall experience was pleasing. Great location and close to the metro. Our room didn't have an iron nor tea. The staff was really nice and the interior and exterior were very clean.
comments  490$Great stay at this hotel! Room was a little small, but all staff were very friendly and helpful. Location was excellent.
comments  491$The location is excellent, the size of the room I s normal for Paris, couldn’t fault the cleanliness of the room. Negatives, not too many. A slight delay checking in as the receptionist (possibly manager) was dealing with domestic staff rotas whilst we stood. Receptionist was still polite. We waited for a few minutes the lift as it was then being used by the staff. The room & ensuite was fine, however there was a poor choice of coffee/tea provisions and the milk was curdled. The picture frame above the bed was far too low, as I caught my head on the corner twice as I sat up, quite dangerous. However despite all stated, I would recommend and stay at this hotel again.
comments  492$Excelent location with every you need at walking distance as eatery, metro station, shopping, and the most impotant tourist atractions. The staff is excelente, friendly, helpful, specially Navid who help us a lot, and Liliane, the lady in charge of service breakfast. The breakfast is excellent it has everything and more !!!!!
comments  493$部屋が狭いとの事だったが、スーツケース2個を開けるほどの床面積はあった。ミニバーが全て無料で良かった。 部屋の不満があればすぐに部屋を変えてくれるサービスも良かった。
comments  494$
comments  495$フロントスタッフは親切で感じよく気持ちよくすごせました。 部屋も立地にしては広いし綺麗に掃除されてました。 ただ、、タオルにシミがあったのとエアコンが全く効かなかったのが残念でした。 隣の音が少し聞こえるのはパリのこのクラスでは当たり前！なので問題なしです。 今まで泊まったパリのどのホテルより相互的に良かったので、また来年も利用するつもりです。
comments  496$Hotel chico pero suficiente para el viaje familiar. Remodelado recientemente, habitaciones espaciosas (considerando que es Europa). Muy limpio, buen servicio y excelentemente ubicado a 1 cuadra de La Madeleine. Shopping, buena comida y turismo a walking distance. Lo único que podría mejorar es el wifi.
comments  497$洗濯物の返却が遅すぎる。遅れても悪びれず業者が遅いだけと取り合わない。改善を求めると逆切れされた。結局選択物が戻ったのはチェックアウト全日の深夜。さらに、朝食抜きの予約であったが、チェックアウト時に自動的に朝食料金を宿泊日数分追加で請求してきた。確認を取ってようやく請求書を修正した。バスタブ付きで部屋が広いこと以外はお勧めできない。

comments  502$L’alarme a sonné deux fois le matin à 8h à cause du grille pain ! Nous étions au 3ème étage et nous sommes descendus à pied dans la précipitation et sous un bruit effroyable !! On leur conseille donc de changer le grille pain et d’acheter aussi une pince à toasts en bois pour les sortir du grille pain sans se brûler !

comments  505$Hotel en travaux- ascenseur sale et petit déjeuner des plus rustiques même pas de charcuterie ou d’œufs brouillés alors que le hall d entrée est très beau / globalement déçu
comments  506$Établissement très propre, les chambres géniales avec le balcon. Pas du tout bruyant je recommande vraiment cet hôtel
comments  507$Le personnel est très accueillant. La localisation et l'atmosphère est très bien mais le rapport qualité prix de la chambre 012 laisse un peu a désirer. Trop cher pour une micro chambre où vous ne pouvez pas rester (<2 m2 autour du lit) sans fenêtre sur l'exterieure 180€/nuit). Malgré la qualite et le service de l'hotel 250€/nuit, c'est trop cher!! (Ex parisien ayant quitté Paris il y a 4 mois et habiter 21 ans a Paris entre le 3eme et le 19eme)

comments  511$J'ai eu une chambre avec une fenêtre donnant sur le hall de réception, aucune vue sur la rue ni possibilité de voir la météo du jour ! c'est inadmissible de ne pas le préciser surtout que sur la réservation est précisé "chambre avec vue sur la ville". Isolation phonique 0, chambre déprimante avec climatisation bruyante. Salle de bain avec douche qui déborde et inonde toute la salle de bain! WC étroit, déco de mauvais goût qui fait bas de gamme. Petit déj très basique. Les 3 étoiles ne sont pas méritées dans mon cas. Points positifs : personnel sympa.
comments  512$La réservation de la chambre a été effectuée sur un site internet. Les photographie de la chambre sur le site ne sont pas en adéquation avec la chambre fournie. Photos beaucoup plus belles que la réalité.
comments  513$Le personnel est sympathique, toutefois je ne conseil pas cet hôtel, chambres mal isolées niveau bruit, en entend les conversations des chambres voisines,nous avons eu une chambre 1 er étage sur rue ... très mauvaises nuits ... rapport qualité prix pas intéressant du tout, de plus ménage plus que léger ...
comments  514$Accueil très froid et chambre ne correspondant pas à l'annonce. Emplacement très bon pour sortie théâtre
comments  515$Bien situé par rapport à la Gare de l'Est et métro Bonsergent, rue calme,
comments  516$Hôtel situé non loin de la place de la République. Grosse déception au niveau de la chambre qui était très exiguë et particulièrement mal insonorisée: nous entendions les bruits du couloir, comme ceux de la rue, comme ceux de nos voisins de chambres. Ainsi, ,nous avons eu la plus grande des difficultés à dormir à cause de ces différentes gênes. Le personnel ne semblait pas être trop préoccupé par nos retours négatifs à ce sujet... Pour rien au monde nous ne remettrons les pieds dans cet hôtel. À éviter pour tous ceux qui espèrent de la tranquillité.
comments  517$Bon accueil. Chambre propre et salle de bien très bien. Notre séjour nous a permis de visiter la capitale.
comments  518$Nous n avons pas pu nous doucher, le pommeau de la douche etant cassé, cela avait été signalé la vieille de notre arrivé mais rien n'a ete fait. Pas une excuse. Rien. Pour un 3 etoiles c' est honteux.
comments  519$Rien à redire sur l'hotel, à tout point de vue. Seul bémol, sur le sitye de réservation la nuit était environ (j'ai eu la bétise de ne pas conserver le montant exact) 85 euros, et là j'ai payé 92 euros; je ne parle pas de la taxe locale, normal. C'est surtou la faute de la SNCF qui a chamboulé son site et j'ai du passer par un intermédiaire pour réserver mon billet de train et la chambre d'hotel. Désolée d'indiquer le prix des chambres mais il est normal que je réagisse;
comments  520$hotel tres bien placé acceuil et reception tres sympathique
comments  521$Bon emplacement. Un peu bruyant si on laisse les fenêtres ouvertes.
comments  522$Je suis arrivé à 2h du matin l homme qui nous a reçu était désagréable exécrable si vous venez en voiture aucun endroit pour se garer la galère si je n étais pas fatiguée j aurais cherché un autre hôtel vu la façon que nous avons été reçu part se monsieur les chambres bien est propres
comments  523$Week-end en famille pour faire du skate place de la République, dîner avec des amis et visiter la cité des Sciences. L’hôtel était bien situé, entre gare de l’Est et République. Deux chambres mitoyennes et communicantes c’est très pratique !
comments  524$Personnel inamical. Même pas un bonjour en arrivant, juste un papier posé nonchalemment sur le comptoir sans même me regarder. Pas de paiement CB en dessous de 20€ donc espèces pour la taxe de séjour. Des travaux dans l’hotel le samedi matin sans même que le personnel ne prévienne. Puis des odeurs de colle de moquette tout le reste du séjour. Non seulement on est pas prévenus mais en plus pas d’excuses et ne parlons même pas d’un geste commercial sur le prix du séjour. Ne pas oublier les boules quies pour les chambres sur la rue, et les voisins de chambre bruyants !
comments  525$Réceptionniste super sympa qui connaît le mot service et surtout très drôle!
comments  526$tres bien .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
comments  527$Même pas une lampe de chevet pour une nuitée à 160 euros, c’est vraiment de l’arnaque
comments  528$Dirty, tiny, has bed bugs, under construction...simply terrible. I left after one night and could not get a refund on any of my stay. Truly disappointing.
comments  529$It was fine. We liked having two interconnecting rooms for us and the kids. There were renovation works on the floor above us but did not disturb us during the night. The breakfast was ok, not lots of choice and no hot options. Location was good near a couple of metros and the bakery next door had lovely lunch options. Please note that you cannot just walk in the building, the reception needs to spot you and unlock the door!
comments  530$The picture showing a double bed and lots of space to wander around doesn’t represent the three rooms we had - they were classic Parisian rooms in which you couldn’t swing a cat. They were what we expected, but in case you expect a room like the picture, the lowest cost rooms are very small. The ‘bathroom’ was, despite being clean, too small to dry yourself after a shower. Sit on the toilet and without moving your feet, stand up to wash your hands! No wasted energy there! The check in guy was extremely friendly but the desk guy who was there when we collected our bags to leave couldn’t even be bothered to look up to say au revoir”!! Good location and typical Parisian hotel.
comments  531$Horrible. Bad quality Hotel I ever Stayed in my life! I would Not go back again! Bad Bad Bad!!!!
comments  532$friendly and helpful staff understanding to my situation and tourist hecticism
comments  533$Room's are small but clean and pleasant staff also good location for your bucks
comments  534$Great location, everything ran very smoothly! I liked the shower, lots of cool jets and the room was clean and exactly as advertised. Will stay here again and would recommend! Very happy with the stay!
comments  535$The front desk personnel were so nice and everyone was so helpful.
comments  536$Good, safe location. Alfedo, the front desk guy was wonderful. He helped us alot. Only think we didn't like was the bright hotel sign in front of our window on all night. It gave us trouble sleeping.
comments  537$Stuff was very friendly and helpful. Elevator need more esthetic look. Hallways need to be remodel because of the smell. Otherwise good location.
comments  538$Location , the fresh greenery band fresh plants was very nice to enjoy 😊
comments  539$Be aware I stayed on November 14, 2019, and it is an outgoing construction on the top floor and next building. Olga was very helpful, such a charmer. Francois was an overnight receptionist--cold, unwelcomed and phlegmatic. I suggest to stay elsewhere unless you love construction. It is unfortunate that the owner of the hotel did not, could not, and would not notify a traveler about outgoing construction activity between hours of 8:30-6pm.
comments  540$Breakfast was continental as expected, croissants and hot chocolate were good. Not many English staying. We had room 2 which was on the ground floor, no external windows.
comments  541$The property was cute, but small. It was located in a nice area. The staff were amazing. It was clean, but there was construction taking place and it was a lot of banging in the morning.
comments  542$It was quite pleasing. It's a great price and very welcoming staff. Don't expect luxury, expect a casual needs-met, kind of property. The building itself, like many old European buildings has more problems - the walls are thin and no noise cancellation. But it was clean and well maintained. If you're an easy going person, who needs a comfortable bed, a decent shower, friendly staff, then this is perfect. It has some places that have room for improvement, but they definitely make it up in other ways. Like, great location; steps from restaurants, walking distance from shops and couple blocks away from 2 metro (subway) stations. Overall, I would definitely be back.
comments  543$The hotel is in a great place to explore Paris for a few days with easy access to public transport and easy walking distances too. Only issues we had were staff were not super helpful; I asked for the night receptionist if there was any restaurants within walking distance and he said no but when we walked around the next day in daylight there was loads! Also the sound proofing of the hotel was not great we could hear the people above us and beside us very clearly.
comments  544$Great place, cozy, and clean. Showers are small but other than that its a typical European room! Would stay again!
comments  545$Good location near to Metro or within walking distance of central Paris. Property was modern but in need of repair
comments  546$Close to metro, restaurant, supermarkets. Clean and safe
comments  547$It was reasonably priced for a fairly central location, within walking distance of Gare du Nord and many tourist attractions, and close to food shops and markets. There is also a Metro station within a 5 minute walk. The exterior and foyer were attractive, and the reception was first-class - friendly, helpful and efficient. Our room was a touch on the small side, but warm, quiet and with comfortable beds - I thought the floor was a bit odd with what looked like black and yellow street markings! The bathroom was well equipped and every-thing worked well. Room service was first-class, and we very much enjoyed our stay.
comments  548$The employees very kind and helpful, specially Alfredo. The room we got too small. There is no enough sound insulation between rooms, you can listen even the adjacent room conversations.
comments  549$Double prélèvement sur mon compte, je trouve ça inacceptable et surtout la réponse de l’hôtel qui me renvoie vers le site comme si l’établissement n’avait rien à voir! Je contacte le site qui a son tour contacte l’hôtel en direct qui finit par reconnaître son erreur. Je suis très en colère et j’attends avec impatience mon remboursement.
comments  550$Un personnel charmant, réactif à nos demandes ( bouteille d’eau, serviettes, consigne bagages ) Efficace et très aimable

comments  559$Très proche de la gare de l' Est et metro
comments  560$Aucune indication sur le site que l'hôtel se trouve le long des voies de la gare de l'est....
comments  561$Propre et lieu pratique pour se déplacer dans paris
comments  562$Hôtel qui mériterait un raffraichissement des équipements et un petit dejeuner plus fourni ,: fruits, oeufs...
comments  563$Chambre propre. Hôtel bien placé pour prendre le train tôt le matin à Gare du Nord.
comments  564$Chambre froide. Le Wifi ne fonctionne pas au 7e étage. Le SdB a besoin d'être redécoré. Mieux vaut choisir l'hôtel Ibis devant le gare de l'est.
comments  565$Boisson à disposition en continue à l'espace petit déjeuner Bon rapport qualité-prix
comments  566$Le personnel affecté au petit déjeuner était très accueillant et coopératif. En revanche, à l'accueil rien n'est fait pour rendre agréable le séjour surtout si la réservation n'a pas été effectuée sur le site officiel de ACCOR pour les détenteurs de la carte de fidélité.
comments  567$Correct dans l'ensemble pas d'autres commentaires Il faisait un peu trop chaud dans la chambre
comments  568$J'ai été satisfaite de la prise en charge de ma demande de changement de chambre rapidement car trop bruyante . Je remercie la personne qui a su comprendre mon souci et j'en tiendrai compte pour revenir lors d'un prochain séjour --

comments  572$situation privilégiée par rapport à la gare de l'est. Transports en commun tout proches
comments  573$accueil desastreux : 1)attente interminable car 1 seule personne et un groupe entier avant nous 2) ne trouve pas notre resa : "allez voir dans l'autre Ibis à 200m" (même pas proposer d'appeler au telephone 3) l'autre Ibis (rouge) ne trouve pas non-plus notre résa !!!! Il appelle votre hotel .... qui retrouve notre résa !!!! 4) retour 200 m a pied, enfin notre résa ... mais aucune excuse !! 5) la resa corrigée en 1 lit double par mail n'est pas respectée car chambre avec 2 lits jumeaux !!!!
comments  574$Correct pour le prix payé mais la salle de bains mérite un peu de rénovation. Proche gare et métro, conciergerie, très pratique
comments  575$Rien à redire en général, seul petit bémol nous étions côté gare, il pleuvait, et le cliqueti de la pluie contre le rebord en tôle de la fenêtre !! Sinon RAS !
comments  576$

comments  580$hotel tres standard mais tres bien situé (gare de l'est) et tres bons produits au petit dejeuner
comments  581$Problème de climatisation dans les chambres. Nous avons changé de chambre, la seconde n'étant pas mieux, nous avons dormi dans une chaleur étouffante. Literie bonne à changer
comments  582$Accueil sympa. Personnel qui vous renseigne et à votre écoute. Proche du métro et du canal st Martin. Concernant le petit déjeuner l'ajout de fruits frais et de fromage serait le bienvenu.
comments  583$Hôtel à 5 mn gare du Nord et gare de l'Est, c'est ce que je voulais....
comments  584$Hotel accueillant proche de la gare bon petit déjeuné

comments  586$Acceuil très chaleureux service au top
comments  587$Nous avions une chambre avec un grand lit et deux lits simples, les literies étaient très confortables. La chambre n'était pas joli du tout mais fonctionnel. Le petit déjeuner était simple mais suffisant. Le personnel était plutôt sympathique. Par contre le ménage dans la chambre mériterait d'être mieux fait.
comments  588$Très bon rapport qualité/prix. Longue attente au petit déjeuner.
comments  589$Chambre basic froide et crue quand on est allé une première fois à la réception on nous a proposé une couette en plus ou ce n'est pas une blague une chaufferette électrique !!!!! À notre départ le préposé a l'accueil nous a expliqué qu'à l'entre saison on ne relance pas encore le chauffage surréaliste quand on voit le prix de la chambre triste
comments  590$La localisation, le déjeuner très copieux, la courtoisie du personnel.
comments  591$Personnel très sympa. A l’ecoute Chambre propre je viens régulièrement et ne changerai pas d’établissement.
comments  592$Très bon bon emplacement, petit déjeuner trop simple
comments  593$Personnels très sympathiques toujours aux services des clients .Pour paris très prix raisonnables
comments  594$Le personnel est tres aimable et serviable. Cet hotel est tres vieux et n'est pas maintenu. La douche ne fonctionnait pas et la temperature de l eau n"etait pas consistante, soit froide ou bouillante et il y avait de la moisissure autour de la baignoire.
comments  595$I had all booked And payed for my daughter birthday, then Covid came and Airfrance decided to cancel flights , when I call hotel to say it is not posible to come anymore they say they will give me voucher for next 18 months to use but the hotel booking company should tell them. I’ve Call your company and no answer for several times. So for me Momondo and hotels . Com were the worst deal I ever made.
comments  596$The toilet floor need to be changed.the quality of it has degraded and dirty. But other than that is in normal condition
comments  597$The bathroom was disgusting - all around the bath was dirty - the floor was not clean - the sink was also dirty, I was not able to take breakfast in the hotel as it was so appalling.
comments  598$Gute Lage, Metro im gleichen Haus, Frühstück war auch gut, Zimmer und Bad sind schon ein wenig abgewohnt aber Preis Leistung ist sehr in Ordnung! Personal sehr freundlich!! Nicht in Ordnung für die heutige Zeit, kein einziger Deutschsprachiger TV Sender!
comments  599$Hôtel bien placé , un peu vieillot , lit confortable , chambre et salle de bain petites .
comments  600$Halte à Paris. Quartier de l’étoile. Très bien placé au calme et à deux pas de l’animation. Confortable, propre, très bon rapport qualité / budget!
comments  601$Hotel bien situé, proche d'un parking public. Personnel très aimable. Hotel sympa
comments  602$Très bon séjour séjour dans cet hôtel: emplacement excellent, dans une rue calme près des Champs-Elysées avec proximité de restaurants à divers prix et ambiances. Les chambres sont petites mais fonctionnelles, très cosy et décorées avec sobriété. Eau offerte et plateau de courtoisie sont des détails appréciables + le PDJ express à 5€. Je reviendrai avec plaisir.
comments  603$Trois nuits du 11 au 14 janvier 2020 Moisissures sur le mur du placard de la chambre 503 Un etat qui fait peur ''sante et moisissures pas tres bon ménages " Malheureusement j ai vue cela a 4h du matin juste avant mon depart a l aeroport Cet établissement vient de perdre un client régulier
comments  604$Cher pour cette toute petite chambre aussi bien placée soit elle!
comments  605$Accueil très professionnel Propreté impeccable Seul inconvénient : le bruit de la VMC qui est gênant Sinon, très bonne insonnorisation de la chambre

comments  611$Personne attentive Chambre simple avec peu de place mais propre et avec le minimum nécessaire
comments  612$Hôtel idéalement placé, calme et sécurisé. Je conseille !
comments  613$2ème séjour dans cet hôtel. Le premier très satisfaisant grâce au déclassement d'une chambre. Le second décevant : chambre très petite, indigne pour un 3 étoiles à ce prix. Porte de la sdb coincée dans la moquette. Porte de la chambre non verrouillable de l'intérieur. Geste commercial appréciable du directeur en dédommagement de ces petits tracas.
comments  614$
comments  615$La chambre était propre. Aucun bruit. La chambre était en revanche très petite, ce qui n'est pas un problème en soi pour une personne seule.
comments  616$Super accueille, très bel hôtel, chambre très confortable.
comments  617$Globalement un bon service. Mais une chambre petite et sous les combles, avec une sdb peu fonctionnelle et agréable.
comments  618$Chambre très petite Personnel super sympa
comments  619$Notre séjour c’est très bien passé, réception toujours ouverte à notre arrivée de 23h00 ce qui est fort agréable
comments  620$IT served the purpose for which it was needed.
comments  621$Nice valentine trip
comments  622$Old hotel, needs an urgent revamp. Tiny room with a noisy fan in the bathroom that doesn’t turn off. Too hot with heating on and too cold when off. Room looked like one of those 1960s student rooms. Location obviously is perfect if you want to be in proximity to Arc de Triomphe. Aside from that, high disappointment for a Best Western hotel
comments  623$I used one of my free nights for this booking, however the hotel charged me the exact amount of the free night. I dont know how to get this refund from the hotel. I request your kind help on this.
comments  624$Location was good, space was small, but as expected in Paris.
comments  625$Great location, great hotel and great breakfast
comments  626$The hotel is located at the center of tourist near Arc d Triomph, lots of restaurant around. The hotel is very clean and updated, breakfast buffet was great. Excellent staff specially Violet who checked us in. Will recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again!
comments  627$Well it took me almost 2 months to write this review. I am back here again hoping that the stay is better. It’s not. The room is old. The wall are so thin. You can hear EVERYTHING! The towels are dirty. The room are so small you can barely move. It is cold. I am so disappointed. It is a one star hotel.
comments  628$Location is the best, cozy place... suitable for solo or couple. staffs were so kind ;)
comments  629$Disappointing. Way too small. Too expensive. Old hotel
comments  630$Quaint pretty little hotel on a quiet side street. Neat historic old building with old world charm. Great staff and very clean with typical small european rooms and Great Air conditioning for summer stays. Would definitely stay here again.
comments  631$Staff is very friendly and done well for quick check-in. She also had some warm welcoming words in Japanese!
comments  632$Central location Fantastic friendly staff Great breakfast
comments  633$Nice Hotel, perfect Location
comments  634$Airline Stopover
comments  635$Great location, friendly staff, comfortable beds, small room, slow lift
comments  636$This hotel is conveniently close to the metro and arc de triumph. The staff kept our luggage past check out which was great. The room was an avaerage european size and did the trick for us!
comments  637$The hotel is conveniently located by the Arc de Triomphe, for site-seeing and taking public transportation. It is located on a pretty quiet side street. The rooms are small, but comfortable.
comments  638$Best western acquired this hotel. However the sign at each room still shows the previous hotel’s name. The room is really small. More like a 8 by 8 room. After putting a full size bed, you barely can walk. We have two big luggages and two small luggages. The room literally can’t fit those. The carpet is like a 1970s inn in the US. And it smells bad. On my second day of arrival, my husband and I took the elevator to our floor. The evevator was stuck between the floors. After pushing the alarm multiple times, still nobody answered us. I guess this would definitely be one of things I would remember forever. Also be aware, I saw the employees themselves write hotel reviews. So maybe that’s why the rating was not bad. But it’s misleading to customers. The hotel overall quality is like those outdated motel inn next to the freeway. Totally not worth the money we paid.
comments  639$The hotel is small and cozy, very good for its category. The room was big enough compared to Paris standards and amenities were decent. The staff is friendly and helpful. The minibar was quite sad (just water, a juice and chips...), I didn’t try the breakfast. Overall I had a positive experience.
comments  640$Very clean, central location and great service-could not ask for more
comments  641$Great location. 3 minutes to Metro station and Arc de Triomphe. Quiet. A basic no frills room. Spacious room by European standards. I did not eat breakfast there. It was around 20 Euros, a bit pricey.
comments  642$My first trip to Paris and this Hotel was a little gem. If you love quaint and clean this has what you are looking for. The room was cozy and cheerful with its ceiling to floor Paris window overlooking its courtyard. Close to local markets for authentic culinary treats, and a few blocks away from l'Arc de Triomphe.
comments  643$Less than a 5 minute walk to the Arc de Triumph and main metro stations. Spacious room and bathroom with great in room facilities.
comments  644$Great location and stay.
comments  645$close to metro and airport direct bus. clean and comfy
comments  646$Great place, people are kind and it has an amazing location. Very close to the public transportation and points of interest. Highly recommended.
comments  647$Hotel is a bit tired and rooms are too small
comments  648$Had a lovely two-night stay. Loved beomg close to the Arc de Triomphe, with easy access to the metro. Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby. Room is small but sufficient. Bed is comfortable. Loved the cute little balcony.
comments  649$Accueil sympathique. Hotel propre et confortable. La proposition de bocaux à emporter en chambre est une bonne idée ( même si la conservation est à améliorer en cuisine: rillettes congelées et dessert tournés).
comments  650$Correct
comments  651$Accueil très aimable. Hotel bien situé.
comments  652$Cet hôtel était parfait ! Situation géographique impeccable par rapport à l'Olympia, propreté irréprochable et accueil incroyable. Le personnel est très arrangeant et ils sont super gentils, ça fait plaisir. Je recommande cet établissement, vous pouvez réserver les yeux fermés.
comments  653$Dans une rue peu fréquentée donc moins de bruit. Chambre propre et refaite il y a peu. Comme beaucoup, faute de rideau de douche ( grande) la salle de bain devient facilement une piscine.
comments  654$Sympa, chambre spacieuse et propre. Un peu de bruit mais le confort de la chambre et la gentillesse du personnel fait oublier ce fait. Je recommande !
comments  655$super chambre, grande et bien équipée, confortable et silencieuse !
comments  656$Odeur désagréable dans la chambre. Moquette escalier sale et usée. Aération bruyante. Rideau douche marron foncé qui empêche la lumière de pénétré dans la douche Accueil de jour comme de nuit très sympathique Pdj satisfaisant
comments  657$Hotel dans quartier calme,chambre petite et mal isolée en interne, ascenseur trop petit aussi, Personnel très gentil et à l écoute Buffet PD peut mieux faire ....peu fourni Séjour correct Quartier assez calme
comments  658$Beau petit hôtel, propre. Les chambres sont suffisantes, propres et bien rénovées. Même si ma chambre donnait sur la rue, je n'ai pas eu de bruit. Des tarifs raisonnables. Un service agréable. Hôtel à recommander et dans lequel je reviendrai sans hésiter.
comments  659$Bon accueil mais ce n'est pas du tout un hôtel 3 étoiles, tout au plus 2 et encore... L'hôtel est vieillot, chambre propre mais peinture totalement défraîchie, humidité au mur, fenêtre double vitrage trop ancienne pour isoler des bruits de la rue, aucune insonorisation entre les chambres, j'en ai presque eu le fou rire... Il est difficile de comprendre comment les administrations laissent cet établissement en 3 étoiles.
comments  660$nous avons apprécié la chambre ainsi que le petit déjeuner très copieux
comments  661$
comments  662$L'accueil a été convivial et chaleureux, on nous a fourni un plan de la ville et des conseils dès notre enregistrement. La chambre était propre (même si la décoration datait un peu) et surtout bien spacieuse pour installer les bagages. La salle de bain était spacieuse également, ce qui est un réel plus à Paris! La gare du nord est à 10 mn de cette rue calme, des bars sympas sont à deux pas ainsi que le métro.
comments  663$Bon séjour dans l'hôtel, très bon accueil. Hôtel au calme, très propre, très bien situé. Il faisait très chaud cette nuit là, et il n'y a pas de climatisation, il y avait une unique couette et pas de drap simple donc on a mal dormi à cause de ça. Odeur de renfermé malgré aération non stop. Petit déjeuner très bien, varié en salé et sucré.
comments  664$Service très acceuillant - bon rapport qualité prix
comments  665$
comments  666$L’hotel est pres des gares, se situé dans une rue tranquille, est très propre, confortable est agréable.
comments  667$Très bien situé au calme et personnel très accueillant. Très propre, bon petit déjeuner.
comments  668$Hôtel très bien situé, bon accueil, petit déjeuner copieux, de nombreux restaurants dans le quartier (pizzéria ZAZAA) .
comments  669$A proximité de la station de métro Poissonnière, dans une rue à sens unique calme. Hôtel très bien qui aurait besoin d'un petit rajeunissement (les couleurs dominantes sont le jaune et le vert et les cloisons sont minces) mais qui reste un bon rapport qualité/prix. La literie est bonne,le petit déjeuner est varié et le personnel très serviable.
comments  670$Le mur entre la 27 et la 28 est bien peu épais. Alors que la 27 est présentée comme venant d'être refaite, la pose d'une isolation phonique aurait été la bienvenue. Sinon le reste est impeccable.
comments  671$Petit dej copieux. Amabilité des réceptionnistes.
comments  672$RAS
comments  673$Hôtel idéalement placé pour aller voir un concert à l'Olympia car pas trop loin de la station de Métro Opéra (15 min à pieds) Superbe accueil ! Petit déjeuner consistant et varié. Rue assez peu passante donc nuit sans bruit de l'extérieur (ce qui est assez rare sur Paris intra-muros)
comments  674$Très bon accueil, réceptionniste très sympathique Chambre convenable Mauvaise isolation, on entend un peu trop les voisins. Bon rapport qualité prix
comments  675$Accueil très chaleureux et établissement bien situé et propre. Petit déjeuner basique mais correct.
comments  676$Among the hotels around, this is now my favorite one. And I stay in Paris every year.
comments  677$Un week end à PAris Tres bon acceuil Chambre simple et propre , qui date un peu mais OK Ascenceur un peu bruyant durant la nuit
comments  678$Avons séjourné 5 nuits. Le personnel est très accueillant, l'hôtel et la chambre sont très propres. L'hôtel est bien situé, à quelques pas d'une station de métro. Les lits étaient confortables et la grandeur de la chambre était correcte pour 2 personnes. Le déjeuner est bien.
comments  679$Hotel dans une rue relativement tranquille et bien situé pour la gare et le métro. Personnel poli et aidant.
comments  680$Super séjour dans cette magnifique ville ! L'hôtel est très bien et super situé à 10 min de la gare du Nord et 5 min de la ligne 7 ! Pas mal visité la ville :) Fait beaucoup de rencontre également ! À refaire sans aucun doute !
comments  681$Very comfortable bedroom, everything clean and tidy. Good heating. Shower room clean and easy to use. Good location. Reception staff very helpful.
comments  682$It’s a cute, small hotel in a great area. It’s a little far from the center of most touristy places, but that made it so much better for me. There are so many cafes and bars around, I felt like I got a real glimpse at the lives of Parisians. The service was absolutely marvelous. The night-time receptionist was so nice and welcoming and very helpful. He’s the best! The room was small but had all the necessities. Warning, there are stairs, which can be a little exhausting after a day of walking around Paris, but I didn’t really mind. I would stay here again, for sure! The only issue was access to public transportation, but that is not up to the hotel. Paris has been on strike for over a month and the station close to the hotel was closed a lot. Again, that’s not the hotel’s fault, and when things go back to normal it will be really accessible for guests to go to the downtown area.
comments  683$Staff were incredible from start to finish, made our trip!
comments  684$Very convenient location. Will stay here again if visit Paris next time.
comments  685$Great location and good hotel for the price. Room is a bit small, but that seems pretty common for Paris.
comments  686$This is a very conveniently located hotel, just minutes from the Gare du Nord and from a metro station. The hotel staff are welcoming and friendly, and the breakfast was good. The room was adequately appointed, although it lacked any tea/coffee-making facilities.
comments  687$Convenience, close to train station n restaurants. Quiet area. No curtain for showers. Water sprayed every where The woman at checked in was not friendly
comments  688$It had the old French charm and near the metro. Place needs to be renovated especially the dingy carpets and the shower room with no glass encasement nor curtain to stop the water from spilling over the floor. Staff were friendly and nice.
comments  689$The hotel staff where very nice. The room we had was newly decorated. The only thing that lets it down was no air con. It get warm in Paris and a fan is not good enough really. I would recommend this hotel still and the location is good.
comments  690$Hotel is a house of horrors lol. I’m not sure how to describe it. The room was small and smelly, the shower didn’t have a door so all the water spilled over to the floor, the elevator was tiny and so old that not even a petite person can fit, staff was unprofessional. Don’t stay here!
comments  691$très bon petit hôtel, transport facile avec métro linge 7. la quartier est tranquille, sécuritaire. il y a beaucoup de restaurants dans le coin.
comments  692$My stay here was marked by the excellent service. All the staff I dealt with were friendly and extremely helpful. Accommodation itself was compact (standard for that level hotel) however was clean and was safe and accessible by walking to downtown Paris.
comments  693$Great location! Right up the street from the metro! Clean and breakfast included!!
comments  694$My wife and I (from Auckland, New Zealand) really enjoyed our stay at the Residence du Pre. We were on level 6 - the nights were hot, we had a fan - had the windows open and it was great (France had a heat wave at the time we were there). The lift was something special and the breakfast was excellent. We arrived at the Gar du Nord and had a 10 minute walk to the hotel which is in a really good location. Down the end of the street were 2 local corner pubs which were GREAT. We recommend this hotel and would certainly stay again.
comments  695$Lovely place to stay. The staff were very helpful, and the location was ideal for exploring Paris.
comments  696$Good location and helpful front desk. Room was basic - no a/c, outdated decor, tiny elevator made luggage transport challenging
comments  697$Friendly staff and convenient for the Eurostar station
comments  698$Good location, near restaurants and subways. Staff very friendly and accommodating and mostly spoke English. TV was very small and had almost no English shows. We got a larger room but it was still pretty small. No fridge or microwave. Wifi was good. Staff walked in on us despite the Do Not Disturb sign, but apologized profusely. Hotel lobby was nice. Small elevator.
