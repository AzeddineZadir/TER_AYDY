comments  0$Très Bien dans l ensemble juste petit dej en chambre froid.... dommage. Top hôtel.
comments  1$Établissement très confortable et personnel accueillant.
comments  2$Déçu, réservation pour 1 nuit. Pas de sèche cheveux, une lampe au plafond qui pandouille, chambre exposée rue donc bruyante. Petit déjeuner un peu cher.
comments  3$Trés belle surprise ! Les chambres sont superbes et l l'agencement tres bien fait.
comments  4$Prestation qui n’est pas à la hauteur du prix de l’hôtel. Très déçu. L’hôtel demande une caution à l’arrivé.. Pourtant les chambres sont loin d’être chargées niveau équipement.. La fenêtre ne fermait pas bien, forcément pas d’isolation sonore. La chauffe serviette ne fonctionne pas. Nous avons organiser un dîner d’anniversaire qui s’est très mal passé niveau service. Rien a dire niveau cuisine c’était excellent. Le serveur nous préviens que les cuisines ferment à 22h00 et accepte une réservation de 15 personnes à 21h30 ... Aucun professionnalisme, le serveur nous reprochait qu’il nous attendait tout le temps. J’ai dû commander mon dessert à la moitié de mon plat.. Très très déçu .. c’est dommage. Même avec réduction je n’y mettrai plus les pieds.
comments  5$Parfait
comments  6$Très bon hôtel. Petit déjeuné et chambre d’un très bon standing.
comments  7$Très bel endroit, soigné, belle déco, staff professionnel, souriant, poli... 5 nuits au calme et reposant
comments  8$Très très beau lieu avec des personnes très sympas.
comments  9$Hôtel sympa, mais qui affiche quand même quelques traces d'usures dans le hall/ascenseurs. Les chambres sont quand à elles, très bien, spacieuses, literie excellente. Le bonus de la salle de fitness est bien quand le mauvais temps s'empare de Paris
comments  10$L’emplacement pas trop loin des transports. La chambre sympa mais la vue cour sur poubelle.
comments  11$Bon emplacement, bon petit dejeuner, design original
comments  12$Un superbe hotel avec une équipe au petits soins
comments  13$Bon choix d'hôtel situé à distance idéale de la Place de la République et des rues du Marais. L'accueil est sympathique et efficace. La chambre est correctement équipée, très propre et fonctionnelle. Il est peut-être un peu dommage qu'elle ne fasse pas écho à la déco des parties communes et des salles de restauration, vivante et agréable. Par contre, l'isolation de la fenêtre sur la rue est à revoir car le boulevard est assez bruyant. Le petit déjeuner manque peut-être un peu d'originalité mais les produits étaient de qualité.
comments  14$Hôtel accueillant différent confortable. Bar et coktails géniaux. Seul bémol : toilettes et salle de bain non séparés, dans la chambre directement ! Bien visible du lit. Intimité absolument pas préservée ! Un rideau ou porte battante serait extrêmement bienvenue.
comments  15$Hôtel agréable et bien placé pour notre séjour touristique
comments  16$Bel hôtel dans quartier vivant. Personnel très accueillant et chaleureux. Très bons petits-déjeuners. Manque juste un plateau de courtoisie en chambre avec bouilloire et cafetière comme dans l’ensemble des établissements 4 étoiles. Nous reviendrons.
comments  17$Tout s'est bien passé, accueil super - néanmoins j'avais sollicité à notre arrivée 2 coupes de champagne..... rien
comments  18$Hôtel très sympa, excellente qualité
comments  19$Great hotel, recommended!
comments  20$Very nice hotel, rooms are big and staff is wonderful
comments  21$Friendly staff, comfortable and clean room
comments  22$Great staff although could explain facilities better when checking in, hotel had a bar that we didn’t find out about until the day we left. Rooms are massive for a European city hotel. The room we stayed in could have done with a little TLC, room was generally clean and tidy but was in need of a lick of paint and touch up. Only issue we had was on the first day the maid wanted to clean our room at 5pm. all in all a good hotel.
comments  23$Absolutely fabulous hotel, from the rooms to the restaurant to the wonderful staff & even to the cool ‘speakeasy’ hidden out the back. We will return as it was an amazing trip! Many thanks.
comments  24$Cool boutique hotel in a very central area of Marais. The staff was very nice and overall loved the design, features, and comfort of the hotel. Everything was great from sleep to amenities.
comments  25$A wonderful somewhat funky boutique property with nice rooms. The only issue we had was that the bathroom was very cold.
comments  26$Shower did not drain. Asked staff to address it, nothing was done. Dirty glasses were left after housekeeping came.
comments  27$Starting from the front desk , they made my first trip to Paris aa enjoyable one. Room with the King bed was awesome and so was breakfadt, staff helpful. Hotel perfectly located in Paris., will stay again.
comments  28$Unique boutique style hotel in a buzzy area, comfortable bed, nice decor and friendly helpful staff(especially Nieves!) would stay again
comments  29$Great location to stay in Paris and lovely hotel. Junior sweet was very spacious. Gym was great and had everything for a good workout. Staff were very lovely and happy to help with any requests.
comments  30$I selected this hotel because it was a VIP property but I did not get any VIP amenities
comments  31$Great staff and wonderful breakfast. We asked to switch rooms because of the noise and they accommodated us right away. Very stylish hotel. Would stay there again.
comments  32$The toilet was in a seperate room from the shower which was strange. The room with the toilet also did not have a sink in it and it was on the opposite site of the shower room than the sink which resulted in a poor layout. The room was very loud. You could hear anyone in the halls and also there was constantly loud music coming from outside at night which made sleeping difficult.
comments  33$Wonderful! Beautiful property, great location, great breakfast.
comments  34$Great location. Friendly staff. The rooms were clean and there was a coffee machine in our family room which was s great bonus after coming in from a long day out.
comments  35$The XL Junior Suite was spacious and clean. My friend and I enjoyed all the space. The bathroom was large and luxurious. Beware it is an open concept bathroom, so you will not have any privacy while showering or bathing. The only door is for the small room with the toilet. This can be tricky when you are staying with someone. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The hotel is in the Marais neighborhood, so you will have access to a plethora of restaurants, cafes, bars, and stores. There is a metro station at the corner, which we used. We also took a lot of Uber rides, and drivers had no issue finding us. If I return to Paris, I would definitely stay there and in request that room!
comments  36$Good location, nice big and clean room, helpful staff.
comments  37$This is a wonderful hotel in a great area. The metro stop is right outside and convenient to get anywhere in Paris. We had to move out of a bad airbnb experience. We moved to this hotel and realized we should have been there the whole time. Staff was wonderful and helpful. Great blow dryers in the room, air conditioning was great. Very Clean! Beds were so comfortable! TV with lots of free movies, big closets. Everything we needed and more! Great price too!
comments  38$XL duplex room was perfect for a family, split level room meant everyone had space but always knew the kids were safe. Housekeeping came every day which meant lovely clean bedding and towels always. The beds were super comfy. Two bathrooms were a much enjoyed luxury. Sadly overcharged on city tax when I left, was charged for my children even though listing says under 18’s were free. Also on our first night had terrible service (given half drinks as tap was broken and still charged full price) in the bar, meant we didn’t go back. Would stay in the hotel again though.
comments  39$Amazing location. Breakfast was awesome. Rooms are big and cozy. Loved this hotel :)
comments  40$Great location, nice hotel.
comments  41$Fantastic... we'll be back
comments  42$Close to a metro stop. Close to the best patisserie in all of Paris (Aux Peches Normands) and the room is huge for Parisian hotels. I did have the deluxe room which is worth paying a little extra for. Staff is very friendly.
comments  43$I had requested a room with two beds in a quiet location. The room was as requested, spacious, with adequate closet space for two females. The beds were fine, though sheets could be softer. Glad we brought our own pillowcases. The a/c was excellent. The bathroom was fine, appreciated the make up mirror and found the shower excellent. The google phone didn’t work well and they forgot to clean my room one day. The hotel is in a great location, neighborhood, close to metro. The lobby bathrooms could use more lighting, maintenance, and upgrading. The staff were always helpful. I absolutely recommend.
comments  44$Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Room was spacious, modern and immaculate. The bed was extremely comfortable. The restaurant and bar were very good. All of the staff were super friendly and very helpful. The location is excellent, very close to two metro stations and lots of cafes.The only negatives for me were that my room was above the bar and the music was a little loud for a few hours in the evening; and the shower had the typical european half wall....water Everywhere!!!
comments  45$The location is great, our room was spacious, and breakfast was wonderful.
comments  46$Loved the location and the people were very nice. The bar was good. The bathroom was poor in terms of a very badly designed shower over the bath which was also not very powerful, glass screen hanging off, tap coming off, grouting coming out, poor lighting etc
comments  47$Great location. Good sized room. Very comfortable. Staff very helpful.
comments  48$Très agréable !! Je recommande
comments  49$Tres bien comme d’habitude avec des proprios tres sympa
comments  50$Mon séjour à l' hôtel fut très agréable. La décoration est très classe. Le petit déjeuner était parfait de plus accompagné de musique française intemporelle. Merci à l'équipe !
comments  51$J'ai séjourné dans une chambre spacieuse, la salle de bains l'était également, le quartier est très chouette, la literie st parfaite, le service adorable. Je n'ai pas pris de pdj.
comments  52$BEL ETABLISSEMENT DANS UN BEAU QUARTIER A QUELQUES PAS DE NOTRE DAME ET DU CELEBRE CABARETE LE PARADIS LATIN
comments  53$Rien à dire très bon hôtel. Bien isolé au niveau bruit sauf les clients qui font du bruit en rentrant le soir
comments  54$Bon pour un court séjour, avec une situation géographique intéressante
comments  55$Excellent rapport qualité / prix dans un quartier de Paris animé. Petit-déjeuner généreux et varié .
comments  56$It is a family and authentic atmosphere in a very touristic neighborhood.
comments  57$
comments  58$Rideau occultant, qui n'occulte pas assez et un réverbère énorme juste devant la fenêtre. Pas de mitigeur et lorsque quelqu'un d'autre prend une douche ou se lave les dents, l'eau devient brulante. Les oreillers sont trop volumineux. Cela peut plaire à certaines personnes et pas à d'autres. Il faudrait proposer 2 tailles d'oreillers. Pas de bouilloire dans la chambre, rien pour se faire un thé ou une tisane le soir.
comments  59$Très bon accueil de l'équipe
comments  60$Rue extrêmement bruyante jusque tard dans la nuit (groupes de personnes qui parlent fort, rient, écoutent de la musique), mauvaise isolation phonique, bouchons d'oreille indispensables pour dormir
comments  61$Hotel TB Expedia beaucoup moins (peut-être par manque d'attention mais j'en suis pas certain) sur le site les petits déjeuner étaient compris, à l'arrivée sur le mail NON Avec
comments  62$2 restaurants et bars à proximité Très bruyant jusque très tard ds la nuit Pas de double vitrage, climatisation en panne
comments  63$une nuit pour affaires Taille de la chambre raisonnable pour Paris
comments  64$Hotel et chambre agréable : Mobilier et aménagement de l'hôtel original. Lit trés confortable, salle de bains de bonne taille. Bon petit déjeuner complet il manque juste une machine expresso. Quelques prises supplémentaires seraient nécessaires proche du bureau dans la chambre et un réglage de la télévision pour avoir toutes les chaines disponibles.
comments  65$Isolations extérieur inssufisante. Quartiers tres bruyant.chambre sans charme.
comments  66$accueil sympathique, chambre assez grande, situation exceptionnelle. la salle de bains est grande et très propre, le petit déjeuner est copieux et varié.Bon rapport qualité/prix
comments  67$Reception par une personne ne parlant pas bien le français...avec légère prise de tête pour régler en CB; étant pressée le lendemain, je voulais payer en arrivant.Cela ne fonctionnait pas;annulation 3 fois de la CB; appel du gérant; attente; encore pbm et prise des arrhes au final...avec suspicion que je n'avais pas la somme !!!En arrivant dans la chambre, cela sentait légèrement la cigarette(mais peut être les personnes avant n'ont pas respecté le contrat...). Le lendemain, aucun pbm pour retirer de l'argent ailleurs..
comments  68$Excellent hôtel, éviter les chambres sur la rue assez bruyantes car bar restaurant en face
comments  69$L'accueil et le confort bien centré, mais lieu passablement bruyant dû à un trafic SUR UN CARREFOUR et des bars sur le trottoir.
comments  70$The staff are so friendly, especially the owner. Welcomed us as if we were family. Comfortable room with view over a street at the side. Nice linen. Up to date style. Nice breakfast
comments  71$Very good, elegant and very convenient
comments  72$Great hotel and very friendly staff. Located in the heart of the Quartier Latin with easy access to Metro stations and buses. Super breakfast. Clean and comfortable with good quality double glazing so when the windows were closed there was no traffic noise. Definitely recommend.
comments  73$Hotel suited our needs well. On a major road so bit noisy but staff were great and let us leave our bags after checkout Thank you
comments  74$The property was located in the 5th district and had the charms of an old hotel that fit right into the scene of the Latin Quarter
comments  75$The main person at the check in desk was amazing. Very helpful with suggestions for restaurants, bakeries, activities, and fun to talk to. And the room was very nice.
comments  76$
comments  77$breakfast should improve, baguette and pastries fresher ; vegetables were missed
comments  78$Location excellent. Bed comfortable. Would have been nice to have an armchair - desk chair base is wooden and hard. Black and red discolouration (mould?) in the bathroom. Towels clean but sad.
comments  79$This is a traditional Parisian building and gives a flavour of the city. That means that if you are looking for an up to the minute swish hotel, you’re in the wrong place but if you want a very well-located hotel with friendly staff, go for it. We stayed on the first floor and there were a few issues - sink tap leaked slightly, window could do with net curtains because it’s so low, and you can hear louder music on Saturday nights - but otherwise it’s fine. We only came in to sleep basically. The aircon works well, there was plenty of hot water day and night, the windows do soundproof barring the Saturday music. As I said, its location is the best asset, 10 mins to walk to the Seine and Notre Dame is pretty good. Also, check out the Pizza Bonvivant just over the road. Lovely pizzas (nothing else on the menu, they do one thing well) and super-friendly staff.
comments  80$Hotel on very busy and loud corner. I would do more research to find quieter, side street in the future.
comments  81$This is a charming, well maintained property, in a wonderful location, close to restaurants and cafes, as well as public transportation. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was was lovely and exceptionally clean, and the beds were comfortable. This is a fabulous hotel!
comments  82$Location is great ! The staff are all very nice and always smiling and helpful. Noise insulation wasn't good enough. Breakfast could be better.
comments  83$OK well located smallish hotel with jus a few problems. Our room was not far from reception on the ground for. Room 001. No noise insulation so we could hear all the comings and goings. Also being the ground floor w were right next door to a (I assume) staff scooter and moped park. The windows were clearly not double or triple glazed. Room wasn't serviced on day 1. We were out all day until 5pm and that's when the turned up just after we'd got back to the hotel. All day to do it, but only pass by at 5? We said no thanks. The staff were all OK, but I have to admit - knowing Paris really well - I wouldn't go back.
comments  84$Nice area to explore. Quiet, but interesting.
comments  85$Friendly staff but room was very small and a bit dated
comments  86$Really nice stay... our bathroom was huge and the room was a good size. I asked for twin beds in advance and got them. The local area is relatively quiet although the walls are thin and you’re more likely to hear what’s going on next door than outside. It didn’t bother us greatly though. Would definitely recommend.
comments  87$Bit pricey for overall value. It was very noisy across the street but that wasn’t hotel’s fault. Nevertheless it was hard to sleep.
comments  88$Great location, very helpful and friendly staff. Convenient neighborhood, walking distance to many sights.
comments  89$Great!!!
comments  90$Love the location. This was my second stay. First was with my daughter, Kara in August 2015. I also referred the Greene family who stayed with you August 2018 before I arrived this time. The only complaint I have is that you are no longer including the breakfast and to pay $14 euros is a bit much. Therefore, we didn't eat your breakfast but went to the diner down the street about a half block and it was super reasonable. We ate most breakfasts at the diner.
comments  91$Short 3 night stay.Only down was the noise from outside early morning with workmen digging the road,however this should end soon. Breakfast was very good and all the staff were very nice and helpful.Would certainly return to this hotel.
comments  92$Great location, excellent staff. Although in busy area it was quiet. AC worked great. Comfortabl!
comments  93$Staff were very acommodating. We booked it last minute as my mom fell ill and could not make the Eurostar back to London. Staff were gracious to split the double bed into two twins even though they were short on staff. That is what I call hospitality. Big bathroom and nice room overlooking Rue des Ecoles and pubs. Lobby is BB cozy with excellent background music.
comments  94$Stayed 9 nights. Superb staff - friendly and helpful! Always eager to listen to my request and handled them without any question with beautiful smiles! Superbly Clean - I am a germophobe. Every hotel room I go to, the first thing I do is to check the bedding and then I wipe every surface with white damp clothes. This was one of the rarest hotel rooms which I could not see any "black" dust stain on the cloth! Every surface was cleaned perfectly! Every single night, I could come back with joy that I can rest in the cleanest possible room in Paris. The new window blocks street noises completely. The room was rather small, but compared to other hotel rooms which my friends stayed, it was a palace. Overall, Fantastic stay. I felt happy from the moment I entered the hotel.
comments  95$Herşey harikaydı selamlar otel personeli
comments  96$Excelente hotel. Todos muito simpáticos. Recomendo.
comments  97$Tres bel endroit avec un personnel super accueillant
comments  98$Séjour agréable, personnel aimable
comments  99$Une chambre assez spacieuse et propre avec un lit confortable Un personnel très a l’écoute
comments  100$Très bien placé pour les champs Élysée et l’arc de triomphe (5 minutes à peine)
comments  101$hotel pas comme dans les photos il fais pas les quatre étoiles
comments  102$Très bon accueil, personnel très sympathique, chambre un peu petite mais agréable, le seul point noir c'est le manque d'une table pour le petit déjeuner, sur le lit c'est pas très confortable. Sinon tout le reste parfait.
comments  103$Proche des champs pratique et agréable
comments  104$Dans l’esprit des appart hôtels, l’Heleazar propose une kitchenette qui vous dépanne pour le café ou un repas sur le pouce. A contrario le petit déjeuner se résume à des viennoiseries, des sachets de thé, café, chocolat des jus d’orange en bouteille 1er prix. Les chambres sont plus petites que prévu et manque cruellement de rangement...Dans l’ensemble la prestation est correcte, le personnel charmant. Le rapport qualité prix est à la hauteur de Paris...
comments  105$Équipements approximatifs, un inventaire qui n'est pas fait mais à signer, manquaient des objets, petits déjeuners commandés et payés mais non prévus par l'établissement. Bof
comments  106$La chambre BERRI ne correspond pas au descriptif qui est fait! La chambre n a pas été faite
comments  107$Jai bien aimé l’accueil le lieu l’environnement juste dommage pour la vue qui était côté trottoir a par sa tout était au Top a refaire
comments  108$Situation sympathique en plein cœur de Paris. En revanche, la personne a l’accueil et démarche de la réception pas très professionnel donne une impression bizarre et nous n’étions pas les seuls à avoir cette sensation.
comments  109$Dès l entrée dans la chambre forte odeur de renfermé et d humidité . Prenons une douche et catastrophe toute la salle de bains inondée 1/2 cm d eau partout ... on patauge ...on a oublié les bottes pour aller aux toilettes ... J appelle la réception et pour toute réponse on me dit que c est de notre faute rideau pas bien mis etc et on me donne un seau et une serpillère ,à moi d éponger .Le lendemain on se garde bien de réutiliser la douche ma femme doit se laver cheveux au lavabo eau froide sèche cheveux HS ... Établissement très bruyant chambre donne sur trottoir et réception juste en face on entend tout .... À FUIR
comments  110$Bon hôtel en général Literie moyenne et coin nuit très très petit Quelques petits problèmes au niveau de la salle d eau (Porte de de douche, odeur de remontée d égouts) Mais au global cela reste un bon établissement, propre, bon service.
comments  111$Idéalement situé et avec un bel espace le séjour a été agréable, l’accueil egalement. Petit bémol pour le ménage
comments  112$Pas de communication avec les chambdres, douche brisé, peut d eclarage..le wiffi tombe toujours Je ne recommande pas cet hotel Ce n est pas un 4 étoile
comments  113$The hotel was very pleasant. The room is small but was adequate for 5 people. The walls are fairly thin and the other room was very close to ours. The hotel was in a great location to walk to just about everything from restaurants to shops and super close to the Arc de Triomphe!
comments  114$Super nice room, fully equiped little kitchen, convinient, clean. Little breakfast served in room. Perfect!
comments  115$This hotel is ideally situated walking distance from Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower, and a few blocks away from the crowds on the Champs-Élysées. Our juniors suite was small by American standards but had everything we needed.
comments  116$The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The rooms were neat and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. And the location was PERFECT to everywhere I wanted to go. Five minute walk to the Metro station and the Champs-élysées. A . I would definitely stay here again.
comments  117$Great value in a perfect location.
comments  118$Hotel room is small, no proper reception desk, first impression with the cleanliness is bad, notorious entrance's floor/carpet.
comments  119$Small but great location! Staff very friendly. It’s practically next to the arc.
comments  120$The Hotel was a beautiful, old French architecture. Rooms were specious and clean. Though, what made the the property really, really excellent was the staff. The front desk staff was extremely accommodating. They brought real value and warmth to our stay. Allowing early checkin ( permitting, the off season). Especially, staff member Enis, who went above and beyond to help us with our activities, looking after our room needs. She even helped us when our flight was canceled and accommodating on short notice at another great property of Helzear, down the street, providing an excellent hospitality experience which made our stay awesome!! Thanks Helzear and thank you Enis, Definitely will stay here again and recommend to friends.
comments  121$I booked two rooms, i booked an extra night for my colleague and he called a number of times to inform them he would arrive late early in the morning and he struggled to get call answered etc and then when he arrived in the morning despite havinf that night booked the room was not available, This was my VP and I used to stay here regularly but my thoughts are to never book or bring my usa colleagues here again you charged for three nights yet he only had two made available - disgusting
comments  122$The location is perfect. Hotel is in clean condition. We were in a 2 bedroom with balcony and kitchen. Elevator is tiny and parking is not in the property, it is right next door and we used our navigation to be in exact location. They provide you a parking map and you are not going to miss it. We didn't get breakfast, they said they don't offer breakfast anymore since no one asks for it anymore, because of the hotel location, people like to eat out, but they said they will provide breakfast if you like. Staff are the best, friendly kind and helpful. Eva, Ines the front desk ladies are so sweet and nice. We had a great time and memorable stay in Paris. The beautiful city of love.
comments  123$Nice smile but unfortunately they don’t do anything to help. First the room was at the street side and ask them to change it but the claim it is the best. Of course it was noisy at street level. Second the door of the hotel have password if you forgot it you have to wait until reception is around to open for you. Third, I tried to contact them many times regarding the insurance deposit they took at check in and never redeposit it back. It is total fraud service and each agent on the phone have a reason not to send email confirmation or need manager to approaval. But unfortunately nothing happen.
comments  124$The location is fantastic. Literally minutes from the Champs Elyse and a 10 minute walk down to the Seine. The property was very clean but it’s on the small side for a family of 4. I would definitely recommend for a short stay in Paris
comments  125$Location was the only plus point. Check-in procedure was painfully slow and the rooms were not ready until 1.5 hours after the 3PM check-in time. Very small waiting area which got crowded with others waiting to check i as well and we had to stand outside. Very tight spaces inside including the elevator. Only one key per room was given for some unknown reason. Probably ok for some backpacking kind of couples but would rather stick to name brand chains in future.
comments  126$Room was too cramped for 3 people. Sofa bed took up entire room and very uncomfortable. Bedroom was a mezzanine level and bed was a mattress on the floor. Bathroom sink didn't drain.Needed extra pillows and none provided after asking. Ines (lady at front desk) VERY rude!! Very expensive for what we got for our money. Good location.
comments  127$The hotel’s location was great for brief sightseeing as we only stayed in Paris one night. Not so great was moving between floors in the hotel for one of our party who is wheelchair bound.
comments  128$The location was great. Near the metro and Champs-Elysee, but the rooms are tiny and the price is quite high for what you get. However, there is a kitchenette which makes it very easy to have snacks and some meals in the suites.
comments  129$Very friendly staff and a great location. Short walk to the Arc D'Triomphe and Eiffel Tower. Great restaurants are very close
comments  130$The rooms were air conditioned which was great with the 42 degree heat! The rooms were well laid out but a bit on the small side. The lift stopped working twice for our visit maybe that was the heat too. We had a leaking kitchen tap but it didn’t affect our stay and otherwise were clean and comfortable !
comments  131$Location is great, walking distance to a lot of places. Hotel and rooms very good always good to have a quick kitchen if needed specially with kids.
comments  132$Heart location , clean , - little small room , but ok for business trip
comments  133$The first person who received us seemed overwhelmed and it took a long time to check us in. He gave us a late check out time and another manager from the next morning was rude to knock at door to say we needed to be out before the time promised while we were getting ready. Also, not a lot of options for help with ordering food for delivery and Internet was terrible.
comments  134$Check in was fast and easy. The room is very small but can't beat the location. It seems that they converted flats into hotel rooms. Good quality finishes but, again, very tight.
comments  135$Fantastic location, the apartment was small but very nicely decorated. Road below was very noisy during the night.
comments  136$Room is clean. We booked superior room for three people
comments  137$We stayed in one of the suites with a second floor loft, it was really pretty, great location near shopping, sites and restaurants
comments  138$This hotel was beautiful and in the best location! The staff was extremely helpful and very fast. The rooms were much more spacious than I had anticipated, and they were very clean. We enjoyed our stay and our looking forward to returning.
comments  139$Cant beat the location, rooms are small but clean, we were out all day anyway,,beds were very comfortable ,,Ines was wonderful on the front desk ,,she was more than gracious any time we needed something and very helpful as was Khalil
comments  140$We liked the location. We were supposed to be in a room with a king bed and a queen pullout sofa. The king bed was up in a loft (not disclosed in the description) and was simply a mattress on the floor (not disclosed). It was shocking.
comments  141$Thanks for Enas she is wonderful and the hotel has always quite
comments  142$The location of this hotel is super. At the very best part of the town and clean with ease of access to everything in walking distance. There is one thing that you need to know: do not compare this hotel with the American hotels standards like large rooms and pools and etc. You will get a small french style room, but you will enjoy it if you are not high maintenance. Th biggest plus is the staff of this hotel, they are so lovely.
comments  143$Ines took great care of us. The location is good for catching the metro & close to some dining. Just down the hill from the Arc de Triomphe.Nice rooms, great bathroom, handy kitchenette to make quick breakfasts & store/reheat leftovers. Good wifi. Fabulous staff!
comments  144$Small hotel with minimal front desk and accommodations. Was tight but comfortable. Very friendly staff!
comments  145$Le hôtel est très bien situé dans la capitale Pour le service des personnes très accueillantes Parfait Je recommande fortement
comments  146$C’était un passage sur Paris prévu à la dernière minute le rapport qualité prix était très bien néanmoins la personne qui nous a confié les clefs a gardé mon numéro de téléphone privé pour me contacter
comments  147$Très bon hotel bien situé, accueil impeccable et propreté au top Seul bémol le matelas qui commence à s'affesser sur 1 côté du lit Bon séjour
comments  148$スタッフの方はとても感じが良いです。ティッシュや必要品が揃っていたのでよかったです。
comments  149$Hôtel propre et très bien situé avec un parking à proximité. Bon rapport qualité prix.
comments  150$Séjour pour tourisme. d'une nuitée. Hôtel correct sans plus. Petite chambre sur la rue, plutôt calme le samedi. Salle de bain propre sans plus. Minuscule placard pour ranger ses affaires. TV presque au plafond. A noter un ascenseur microscopique. Hôtel bien situé géographiquement par contre.
comments  151$Personnel très serviable qui "compense" les manques au niveau du bâtiment/des installations (ascenseur minuscule et presque impossible à utiliser avec deux valises et 1 seule petite personne; certainement pas aux normes requises dans un établissement hotelier de cette catégorie..; couloirs étroits et sombres; litterie très propre mais pas d'un confort maximal..armoire "improvisée".... Bref, avec quelques améliorations raisonnables, ce serait beaucoup mieux car bien situé.
comments  152$Lit de mauvais qualité, matelas très très dur et déformé. La moquette est plus confortable.
comments  153$C'est hors de prix pour ce que c'est. Le Wifi ne fonctionne pas, la télé non plus. La salle de bain est si petite que lorsque l'on est sur les toilettes, le lavabo gène ! On ne peut même pas rentrer dans l'ascenseur avec les valises !!! Honteux !
comments  154$Chambre confortable et silencieuse. Le point négatif se situe sur la salle de bain où des crèmes pour le corps sont proposées dans des échantillons déjà ouverts (et donc le tube à moitié vide) et des petites boites "pack pour la douche" vides elles aussi. Allez comprendre l'intérêt ! De fait, heureusement qu'il y a un distributeur de savon dans la douche, et espérons que ce soit un savon / shampoing (personnellement, je n'ai pas pris le risque de tenter).
comments  155$une expérinece client desastreuse: - débité avant d'arriver alors que je devais payer sur place et donc pas de facture! ni sur le site Hotels.com - ascenseur minuscule -pas de papier toilette ! -hôtel surchauffé même radiateur coupé -très bruyant
comments  156$Très bien situé’personnel très agréable et compétent Ascenseur minuscule chambre petite salle de bain idem Bonne insonorisation pb d odeur d égout gênante chambre propre Bilan mitigé
comments  157$Great location, hotel is OK for a 3 star
comments  158$I stayed at Opera Vivaldi while on business trip. Location is good. You can walk down to Louvre and the center. ride to airport is fine with a taxi. Rooms are basic but you have everything you need, wardrobe, hairdryer, bottles of water, shower accessories, everything. The only suggestion: remove the safe box, or move it to some other place to make room to hang the suits. Breakfast is OK. The tables are small, but the variety of things to eat and their quality is fine.
comments  159$Good location near shopping areas and within walking distance to the Louvre and Montmartre area when there was a public transport strike.
comments  160$😌 comfortable and very well located. Helpful staff make it easy and welcoming.
comments  161$The photos was misleading and not at all what was provided. Bed old and over used
comments  162$My daughter and i went to paris and we found this hotel to be very safe. We found the hotel to be very clean and we were very thankful to have soundproof windows as there is work being done across the road. The mattresses aren’t the best and there isnt any air conditioning but for a 3 star it is great. Thank you for a great rune
comments  163$Dirty tiny rooms that desperately need revamping, stained smelly carpet, minuscule elevator can only take one person.
comments  164$
comments  165$4 days at Paris enjoying the lovely city. We always stay at Hotel Opera Vivaldi as we find it very convenient .. prime location, steps from two metro stations that take you anywhere, the staff are always freindly and helpful and all comes within reasonable price.
comments  166$Good size room for a Paris hotel, staff pleasant, however 12 Euro for breakfast is a bit steep when you can get it in a local restaurant for 9.50 Euro.
comments  167$The room was smaller than I expected but well laid out. Smallest elevator I've ever been in but worth a good laugh.
comments  168$This hotel was convenient for metro and shops on the grand boulevard. Also easy walk to Louvre. Bed was super comfy. Downside was lack of hanging space and drawers .
comments  169$Nice location close to metro, shopping and different restaurants.
comments  170$オペラ駅から近く、どの場所へ行くにもアクセスがよかったです。
comments  171$立地が本当に良いです！ギャラリーラファイエットやオペラ座は、通りに出て直ぐですのでロワシーバスの停留所もスーツケースを転がしても苦痛なく着きますし、地下鉄もすぐ近くにあります。近くにマックやバーガーキング、イートインできるパン屋さんがあります。アメニティは石鹸程度で、タオルの交換は頼まないとしてくれませんが、部屋はいつもベットメイクしていただきました。エレベーターは、びっくりする程狭く、向かいの建物が工事中なので、少し騒がしいのですが、寝るだけと割り切れれば、ホテル代もお手軽なので、お勧めできます！
comments  172$いつもここに泊まります。オペラ地区では安いです。オペラ座も近いし、朝食も品数は多くありませんが美味しいです。
comments  173$とても立地が良くパリに来た時はこちらを利用させていただいておりますが 今回は特に 浴室の臭いが強く いつも窓を開けて換気をしていないと部屋にいられません スタッフはとても親切で良い人ばかりでした 臭いだけ改善していただきたいです
comments  174$オペラ座やラファイエットのすぐそば、ルーブル美術館なども徒歩圏内。CDG空港行きのオルリーバスの乗り場も近い立地抜群でとても便利なホテルでした。 お部屋も、セキュリティボックス、ポットはあります。冷蔵庫は私の部屋はありませんでした。 唯一エレベーターがかなり狭いのがマイナス面ですが、それ以外は問題なし。 次回、パリに行くときはまた泊まりたい思います。
comments  175$Accoglienza in centro servitissima. Piccole stanze sopratutto la doccia ma accogliente.
comments  176$初日で疲れてるであろうと思いロワシーバスの到着近くの宿を所望し予約した。 場所はいいが宿はあまり良くない。 狭くてトイレもシャワーもとにかく使いにくい。
comments  177$la posizione è favolosa in pieno centro tra l opera e la fayette.. camera piccola ma pulita. personale gentilissimo e ottima colazione. lo consiglio e ci torneró
comments  178$Very convenient hotel next to Opera station and close to the Roissybus stop (bus to CDG airport). The room was nice and clean and the area has a lot of restaurants close by.

comments  187$立地はいいが、部屋は狭く壁も薄い。シーツも洗ってくれず、清掃が行き届いていなかった。
comments  188$シャンプーの量が少なかった
comments  189$全くバスタオルの取り換えが無い。
comments  190$En general el servicio de la recepción es excelente. El hotel es, por no haber otra palabra, muy pequeño, los espacios son reducidos. La habitación de dos camas es buena la recomiendo. La zona es inmejorable. Muy céntrico. La liempieza no era buena, solo hacían las camas, pero no barrían la alfombra no sacaban la basura, no se hacía buena limpieza en el baño. El desayuno es aceptable. El elevador es el mas pequeño al que me he subido en toda mi vida. El wifi es pésimo.
comments  191$Ubicacion y atencion excelente, muy limpio y bonito, la habitacion era muy pequeña no especificaron que era tan pequeña pero igual fue confortable, el wifi excelente
comments  192$立地からいつも利用していますが、全てが狭く色々大変です。ネット環境が今回非常に悪く、次回は選択肢から外すべきかな、と思っています。

comments  195$J'ai été très déçu, car j'ai réservé cet hôtel car dans le descriptif de réservation été noté chambre avec baignoire, et au finale c'était une douche donc très déçu. Même en exprimant ma déception à l'accueil, ça n'a rien changé. La chambre était très bruyante.

comments  199$L'hôtel est bien placé, près du métro et des commerces. Notre chambre etait petite mais très propre, en très bon état et fonctionnelle. En revanche l'accueil a été désastreux (le réceptionniste a refusé de faire le check-in tant que mon compagnon n'était pas là car c'est lui qui avait fait la réservation - une heure d'attente). De plus L'hôtel est mal insonorisé.

comments  202$Très bonne adresse.

comments  215$Très bon WE dans cet hôtel, à 2 pas d’en l’Arc de Triomphe. Propre, confortable et avec un petit déjeuner gratuit qui vaut largement certains petits déjeuners payants de certains établissements.
comments  216$très bon accueil, seul et unique souci : ne pas prendre son petit déjeuner trop top. Le reste est parfait
comments  217$D'habitude je mets des remarques plutôt positives sur cet hôtel , mais au cour de ce dernier séjour ,il m'a été attribué une chambre minuscule avec vue sur une cour intérieure au 1er étage ... catastrophique!
comments  218$Hôtel très agréable. Chambre donnant sur rue calme. Bon quartier sur et pratique. Chambre confortable, bonne literie. Salle de bain propre. L'équipe masculine à l'accueil pas toujours agréable,ni efficace, souvent débordée au téléphone alors qu'on patiente en face pour le Check out avec avion à prendre.

comments  223$Cette hôtel est catastrophique j’ai déjà mis un avis sur votre site il y a peu de temps : chambre minuscule, lit collé au mur, salle de bain où on ne peut accéder à la cuvette des toilettes tellement l’espace avec la douche est étroit (et je suis petite j’imagine Un homme de 1,85 m) et les employés sont détestables, pas aimables du tout surtout les hommes, la moquette est sale, il n’y a aucun rayonnage pour poser des vêtements ou affaires ni dans la salle de bain ni dans la chambre, etc. Je ne le conseille pas
comments  224$Excellent accueil, très propre et confortable
comments  225$Hôtel décevant pour un 3 étoiles. Chambre minuscule mais salle de bain très propre et récente. Petit-déjeuner moyen, le pain était à peine frais.

comments  229$Nous avons passé un excellent séjour. Hotel très propre et très confotable, en plus du déjeuner avec une grande variété. Par contre, aucune machine à glace et aucune glace disponible, un peu surprenant pour un hotel.
comments  230$Hôtel très agréable et très bien situé pour découvrir Paris
comments  231$Very nice and clean and in a great location. The breakfast was very good.
comments  232$Excellent location. Front desk staff was great! Room was great!!! The only thing I didn’t like was that the lady in charged of the breakfast was very rude!
comments  233$Good, clean, friendly and reliable price for hotel and breakfast included.
comments  234$Friendly welcome at the hotel. Rooms as expected were small. Unfortunately even though it was January the rooms were uncomfortably warm. Put air-con on with little effect. Breakfast was great, enough choice for everyone. Location was excellent, plenty of bars/restaurants around, and easy to get to the sites and transport. Would stay again, thank you
comments  235$small room, but practical and quiet
comments  236$Vaccation
comments  237$It was walking distance to the center of the city: Arc de Triomphe!
comments  238$Rooms are updated but very small. TV had a large scratch on the screen. If you have more than one bag of luggage, you will struggle with space. Not allowed to bring food to the room... I got yelled at by the staff because I was bringing my sick girlfriend breakfast. Great location, but I would not go back.
comments  239$Friendly staff, clean rooms, good WiFi and very good breakfast in the morning. Staff were successful in meeting my need for an early check-in which is a big plus from my side. Rooms are relatively small but I guess that this is kinda typical in Paris.
comments  240$Excellent location! Property is older and the rooms need some TLC. The staff is great and the breakfast which is included had an excellent selection for all.
comments  241$We were charged for a bottle of water despite telling we did not use it.staff didn't wish us when we checked out .They were more concerned about 2.50 euros.Also staff was irritated when I requested bread which ran out at 9 am although breakfast was till 10 and couldn't understand why this unfriendly attitude. Is this how Parisians treat their guests??
comments  242$Close to tourist attractions and food. Lovely rooms and bathrooms. The staff were very helpful.
comments  243$Near the Arc de Triompe HOHO stop , lots of restaurants around the area

comments  254$Bon hôtel impeccable personnel courtois Très proche de la gare de Lyon
comments  255$séjour agréable, les 2 personnes rencontrées à l'accueil ( une dame et un monsieur la nuit) très sympathique et très professionnelles. Bon service au petit déjeuner, chambre agréable Le seul bémol: le bruit de la circulation la nuit
comments  256$Hôtel situé dans un très bel immeuble bourgeois à deux pas de la gare de Lyon. Très bien tenu. Chambre très confortable et cossue. Un très bon séjour.
comments  257$Proche de la gare, accessible facilement. Le seul bémol est l’absence du clim
comments  258$La chambre est nickel, rien à redire là-dessus. Juste peut-être la salle de bain est un peu étroite pour de grand gabarit. Et j'ai trouvé la literie un peu passable. Sinon, niveau bruit, je n'ai rien entendu. J'étais côté gare et c'était vraiment calme. Petite bouilloire à disposition et télé en état! Je recommande vivement! Ah! Et des gens sympa à l’accueil.
comments  259$Durant la pandémie pas possible de vous joindre afin de trouver un arrangement sur ma location.

comments  262$Weekend à Paris en couple très agréable,hôtel très confortable, bien situé à deux pas de la gare de Lyon,personnel souriant, à l'écoute et très serviable
comments  263$Concernant les chambres très bien, propreté rien à redire, l accueil bien aussi. Point négatif salle pour le petit déjeuner trop petite et quand vous arrivez à 8 h 45 pour le petit déjeuner plus grand chose à manger (plus de viennoiseries, plus de jus d'orange par exemple) en revanche le prix ne change pas 11 e donc à ce niveau rapport qualité prix médiocre
comments  264$Vraiment sympathique, les chambres sont jolies, le personnel agréable. Très bien placé à côté d'un supermarché et d'un métro. A part un problème avec la douche qui avait du mal à s'ouvrir et se fermer(ma compagne a eu besoin de mon aide pour en sortir), je conseille

comments  268$bon accueil et échanges sympa, chambre très propre, proche gare de Lyon et pas bruyant
comments  269$Bon pour la proximité de la gare, sans intérêt pour le reste : chantage à la confirmation, accueil sexiste et peu agréable, entretien calamiteux (manque une ampoule table de chevet, prise de courant cassée, pas de papier toilette dans le dévidoir, pas de sac poubelle dans la salle de douche... Et une odeur de javelle dans toute la chambre très incomodante

comments  275$m2 coin douche et wc compris c'est un très juste !!!.si vous faites 45 kgs et mesurez 1m45 c'est peut être faisable ???. Pour s'asseoir sur les wc il faut se mettre en biais, c'est pas confortable. il faisait frais la nuit, donc le rhume assuré!!! Je n'y reviendrai pas, rien à voir avec les photos alléchantes
comments  276$Dommage que dans salle de bains des remontées d'odeurs d'évacuation ou égouts ont infestées cette pièce mais pas de remarque particulière sur la propreté. Ceci a été signalé à la Direction qui devait voir.

Etablissement propre, personnel accueillant et serviable, chambre confortable et petit déjeuner correct (avec pain et croissant frais).

comments  303$Pour ce prix à Paris c’est correct, mais il faut pas s’attendre à grande chose. À la limite juste pour une nuit pour dépanner
comments  304$Chambre propre avec TV et autres services mais nous avons vu une souris dans le couloir et le réceptionniste avait l'air surpris, ma fille de 2 a's avait peur de marcher dans ce couloir de plus, il n y a pas de parking et on sait que les places de parking à Paris sont difficiles à trouver. Je recommande si vous n'êtes pas véhiculé et que vous venez sans enfant pour quelques jours...

comments  319$Je ne sais je ne suis pas allé
comments  320$La chambre etait tres bien. Le seul point negatif c'est cette odeur de colle entêtante dû à des travaux à un autre étage. Lee petit déjeuner pourrait être étoffé.
comments  321$Tres beau séjour a cette hotel nous avons bien aimer
comments  322$convenient location, close to metro, bus, train. lots of restaurant, bars, bakery, market nearby. I know that it is for security purpose but you need to leave your key at the counter every time you leave the hotel.
comments  323$Small room but nice place and good location near the city centre
comments  324$Pleasant clean room in a good location near two metro stations.
comments  325$The Manager is really friendly and helpful !
comments  326$My family and I really enjoyed our stay here! Fresh pillows, towels, and other necessities were provided daily. Air conditioning worked perfectly as well. Also, I really enjoyed that they have an elevator (even though it’s tiny) because not many hotels in the area have elevators. Our room was super modern-looking, it looks way better than it did in photos! Beds were also very comfortable. Front desk person was always there 24/7, which made me feel safe! And on top of everything, the location is amazing! There are lots of restaurants, markets, and small shops that are only a few steps away. Would definitely stay here again. We had absolutely no problems at this hotel!
comments  327$Great location in Bastille but extremely minimal accommodations. We needed 3 twin beds in one room which is harder to find, and it worked well for that. The bathroom/shower feels like a boat bathroom and is tiny, even for comparable European standards. There is no lighting in the stair way on the lower floor and it's almost impossible to see. If you are looking for the most basic accommodations in an area that is awesome for food, walking places, etc - it's decent. But keep your expectations realistic. Staff nice and kind.
comments  328$Location is convenient and close to metro station as well as the Marais neighbourhood. Staff were ok. Overall condition of the hotel (rooms, hallways, even staircase etc) rather disappointing. Definitely overpriced - not worth staying here. We have been regularly visiting Paris since 2008 and this was easily the worst hotel we have stayed at.
comments  329$the toilet/shower was really small like in a ship... price is a lot for what you get
comments  330$Good location, plenty of bars, restaurants and cafes in the local area, and close to two Metro stations for access into Paris. The hotel was fine, we booked a triple room which was a bit on the small side and cramped for three people.
comments  331$Rooms are really small but clean. Fantastic if you are alone or travelling light. Extremely close to Bastille station. And down the street from indi designers and watering holes. Has a lift!
comments  332$The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We stayed 3 to a room, which wasnt too cramped. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. We only really stayed at the hotel to sleep, so it is perfect if you are looking for a place to sleep. I would reccommend to a friend.
comments  333$Excellent place to stay in Paris Nice area & easy accessible to metro Extreme friendly staff & very helpfull
comments  334$Very nice staff. Room was comfortable, clean, and quiet. Very close to the metro station. Eateries, bars, and convenient stores at door step.
comments  335$It was a great stay overall, and it was a long one. It is definitely not a fancy place and the room was very basic but it was ok. They cleaned every day, brought fresh towels and if you need anything you can always ask reception. Everyone was very nice at the hotel and I felt very comfortable and felt secure, I was traveling solo. Being summer in Paris it gets very hot, but the room had air conditioning which was great. Elevator is very small but no real problem with it. Even though it is very basic, it is worth the money, the Bastille area where it is located is awesome, lots of restaurants and cafes, like a block away from the metro line 1 which is the one that will take you to all the main attractions and very very near to Le Marais, which is a very trendy nice area in Paris (and a lot more expensive to stay in) where you can hang out and even do some shopping. I will go back and stay there next year most likely.
comments  336$Great neighborhood! Super friendly staff. Amazingly comfortable beds. Rooms are small, but do the trick. We had a 4 man with a queen/double bed and two twin beds. Convenient to the metro, bars, and restaurants.
comments  337$Good location. Small clean room and bathroom. Safe did not work Initially told we could not have the air-conditioning on but after 2 nights it was put on - much improved our stay.
comments  338$Room was tiny but clean and comfortable, bit noisy and have a great area close by for food and Metro is 1 block away
comments  339$Второй раз во Франции - решили расположиться восточнее, около пл.Бастилии. Расположение - супер. Администраторы русскоговорящие - супер. Не повезло с забастовками и метро - не супер. Приехали уставшие с рождественской ночи из Страсбурга и нас заселили раньше времени в наш номер, большое спасибо за этот жест, номер чистый и приятный. Крутой лифт! Стены не очень толстые, соседей было слышно, ну и проходящих за дверью из-за щели под входной дверью, особенно кричащих бесцеремонных китайцев, которые не уважают чужой покой и перекрикиваются на своё языке с разных концов коридора. Душевая кабина удобная, немного была продавлена кнопка на унитазе, приходилось поправлять чтобы не журчала вода.
comments  340$väldigt litet rum och sjukt liten hiss. bra för nära vänner kanske
